            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19538:3"/>
of them to obtaine and finde your Honour moſt ready and eaſie in yeelding your aſſent. For, were it that your auncient fauour and good will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifoldly extended to my father, who long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this mortality, had not at all ſtretched to met his ſonne, but had with him alone both liued &amp; died: Yet might not I, without ſome skar of impiety, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that euer the memory of that ſhould die in mee, the profit &amp; pleaſure whereof I knew in him ſo long to liue. But ſeeing it hath further alſo, as I lately was giuen to vnderſtand, ſo pleaſed your Honour, that this happy courſe of your fauor ſhould not begin &amp; end in one, but ſhould continue &amp; lineally run on; &amp; that the force &amp; vertue thereof, ſhould paſſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuately from the root vnto the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches: much more blameable verily would be my ſilent forgetfulneſſe, &amp; double would the fault be, where dutie doublie is required.

But the <hi>Decalog</hi> is the ſumme of the Law: and therefore is it to be referred vnto the Law, which is the former part. <hi>The Creede</hi> conteineth the ſumme of the Goſpel: and therefore muſt it be referred vnto the Goſpell, which is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part. <hi>The Sacraments</hi> are as appurtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces adioined vnto the doctrine of the Goſpel: therfore alſo they are referred vnto the ſecond part. <hi>Praier</hi> is a part of the worſhip of God; and therefore to be referred vnto the Law.

For al the doctrine concerning God is either of the nature, or of the will, or of the workes of God.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19538:12"/>
Wherefore what the nature of God is, is taught in the Law and Goſpel. His wil is ſeene either in his commandements, or in his threatnings, or in his promiſes. Now his works ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are his benefites, or the iudgementes of his will, which are to be beheld in the creation, after the fal, &amp; in the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of man.

Wherefore the Law &amp; the Goſpel are the chiefe generall heads which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend al the doctrine of the Scripture.</p>

But after that once he was conuerted, and had perceaued the truth of doctrine; that his faith was not now any more builded on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church, but on a far other foundation, himſelfe is a moſt ſufficient witnes for vs, whereas in the ſelfeſame book,<note place="margin">Therefore he did beleeue the Church eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it.</note> cap. 14. he ſaith on this wiſe: <hi>Thou haſt purpoſed nothing els but to commend that thy ſelfe beleeueſt, and to laugh at that which I beleeue.

Wherefore there is a double difference eſpecially by which true miracles are ſeuered from falſe.</p>
                        <p>For firſt thoſe miracles which are vaunted of by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the church are ſuch,<note place="margin">They differ. 1 In the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> as without changing the courſe and order of nature may bee done by the ſleightes &amp; iuglings of men or diuels: &amp; ſeeme therefore to others to be miracles, becauſe they perceiue not the cauſes of them,<note place="margin">2 In the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles with which god hath ſet foorth his church, are works either beſides or contrarie vnto the courſe of nature and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, and therefore not wrought but by the power of God. The which that it might be the more manifeſt, god hath wrought many miracles for the confirming of his truth, whoſe verie ſhew the diuel is neuer able to imitate or reſemble: as are the raiſing of the dead, to ſtay or call backe the courſe of the Sunne, to make fruitles and barrain

women fruitful. But eſpecially the miracles of God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their endes from the diueliſh and fained. For they confirme nothing but which is agreeing with thoſe thinges which afore time were reuealed by God, and that in reſpect of the glorie of the true God, of godlines, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and the ſaluation of men,</p>

For he may after the ſame maner giue the lie to al both ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hiſtories. But let vs firſt vnderſtand, that as other parts of the holy ſtory, ſo eſpecially the miracles are recited, as things not wrought in a corner, but done in the publik face of the Church and mankind. In vaine ſhould the Prophets and Apoſtles haue had endeuored to get credit vnto their doctrine by miracles, which men had neuer ſeen. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the doctrine which they brought, was ſtrange vnto the iudegement of reaſon, and contrarie to the affections of men: and therefore their miracles, except they had bin moſt manifeſt, woulde neuer haue found credite. Alſo it clearly appeareth, both in the miracles themſelues, and in the doctrine which is confirmed by them, that they who writte them, ſought not their owne glory or other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this life, but only the glory of God, &amp; mens ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To theſe arguments agreeth not only the Teſtimonie of the Church, but the confeſſion alſo of the verie enemies of Chriſt, who ſurely, if by any meanes they could, woulde haue denied and ſuppreſſed euen thoſe thinges that were true and knowen, much leſſe would they haue confirmed by their Teſtimony ought that had beene forged or obſcure.</p>

Now all thinges, of which there vſeth to ariſe queſtions in the Chriſtian Church, doe appertaine either vnto doctrine, or vnto diſcipline and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. That the word of God ought to be the rule vnto both ſorts, it is out of doubt. But in this place wee ſpeake of the doctrine of the church, which conſiſteth in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and decrees, which wee are bound by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God to beleeue or obey: and therefore they can not bee chaunged, by the autoritie of any creature: &amp; they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19538:23"/>
are become obnoxious vnto the wrath of God, whoſoeuer ſubmit not themſelues in faith and obedience vnto them. To theſe decrees and preceptes the Papiſts adde many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which not onely are no where deliuered in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but are repugnant vnto it; and they contend, that the Church or the Biſhops haue autoritie of decreeing: yea contrarie and beſides the Scripture, what the Church muſt beleeue or doe: and that mens conſciences are bound by thoſe decrees no leſſe than by the woordes of the holy Scripture to beleeue or obey.

Againe, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are beleeued on their own word, becauſe we know that God ſpeaketh with vs in them: others haue credit, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelues ſay ſo, but becauſe the ſcripture witneſſeth ſo, neither a whit more than they can proue by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore we doe not reiect others doctrine and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors in the Church: but onely ſetting them in their owne place, we ſubmit them vnto the rule of Gods word. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine firſt is deliuered of God himſelfe, and that not in one place onely of the Scripture: as Deut. 4. <hi>You ſhal not ad vnto the word which I ſpeak vnto you, neither ſhal you take away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</hi> And in the laſt Chapter of the Apocalyps: <hi>I proteſt vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man, that heareth the words of the Propheſie of this book, if any man ſhal ad vnto theſe things, God ſhal adde vnto him the plagues that are written in this book.

no falſe things &amp; openly repugnant to the written woord be added to the doctrine of the church, but alſo that no vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things, or things not appertaining vnto it be mingled therewith.

For therefore is the authoritie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles far higher, then of other Miniſters of the Church: becauſe God called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immediatly, to declare his will vnto other men, and adorned them with Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of miracles and other thinges, by which hee witneſſed that he did ſo lighten and guide their minds with his ſpirit, that he ſuffered them to erre in no one point of doctrine: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miniſters are called by men, and may erre, and doe erre, when they depart from the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles. Wherefore the Apoſtle Paul, Ephe. 2. ſaieth: <hi>That the Church is builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</hi> And 1. Cor. 3. <hi>That hee had laied the foundation, and other then that could no man lay: others build vpon it gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, precious ſtones, wood, hay, ſtubble.</hi> Now it is manifeſt that they, who may err, ought to be tied vnto their doctrine, who are warranted by the teſtimonies of God that they can not erre. Wherefore all other teachers in the Church muſt not bring any new point of doctrine, but onely propound and expound thoſe thinges vnto the Church, which are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>For theſe cauſes therefore doth the whole auncient Church with great conſent ſubmit it ſelfe vnto the rule of

But the miniſterial power is ſuperiour vnto the ciuil in thoſe things, which belong properly vnto the miniſterie, that is, which are of God deliuered, commaunded, and committed vnto the miniſters, that by them they may bee declared vnto the Church. But of matters indifferent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which nothing is either commanded or forbidden of God, the ciuil power is ſuperiour, by reaſon of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which God in theſe matters hath giuen vnto the ciuil magiſtrate, and not to the miniſters of the Church.</p>

                     <p>THE ſcope and ende of this doctrine is, that wee may haue ſure comfort both in our life &amp; at our death. And that wee may haue this, wee are eſpeciallie to learne the doctrine of Chriſtianitie. Now the ſumme of this comfort doth conſiſt in this, that <hi>wee are the members of Chriſt:</hi> that is, that we are engraffed into Chriſt by faith, that he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of vs: and that by him wee are loued of God, reconciled to God, and conioyned with him. This comfort the diuel goeth about to take from vs after this maner. 1. <hi>Thou art a ſinner: therefore thou art not acceptable in the ſight of God.</hi>

For thou maiſt fall and periſh; becauſe it is a long way to heauen. Anſwere.</hi> Chriſt hath not onely merited his benefites for mee, but alſo beſtoweth them on me, and preſerueth them in mee, and giueth mee perſeuerance, that I may not fall from grace. 4. <hi>But what if theſe thinges appertaine not vnto thee? and how knoweſt thou that thou art Chriſtes?

Therefore I haue true faith, and by a conſequent, Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites appertaine vnto mee.</p>

This comfort, though other ſectes promiſe, yet can they not make performance thereof, becauſe their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and experience oftentimes goeth againſt them.

                        <hi>The partet of this comfort are,</hi> 1.

                        <hi>The knowledge of our deliuerie is neceſſarie for our comfort.</hi> 1. Becauſe a good thing, not knowen, is not deſired: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>There is no coueting after an vnknowen thing.</hi> When wee haue found it alſo, if wee knowe not what it is, wee deſire it not, and therefore doe not obtaine it. Yea that verie meanes, by which wee attaine vnto our deliuerie, requireth the knowledge of our deliuerie. For thou ſhalt er in the deſire of thy deliuery, except thou know what, and of what qualitie it is, and after what manner it is receiued. Furthermore, wee are made by faith partakers of this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie. But faith is not without knowledge. Wherefore the knowledge of our deliuerie is neceſſarie, both that we may obtaine it: &amp; alſo becauſe the mean &amp; inſtrument it ſelfe, by which we do obtaine it, cannot bee without the knowledge of our deliuerie. 2. A good thing not knowen doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: that therefore it may comfort thee, thou muſt knowe how great and what maner a good thing it is. 3. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our deliuerie is neceſſarie, that we may be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: becauſe for a thing not knowen to be good wee vſe not to giue thankes, for that we make light account of it: and if we wil be indeed grateful, al the circumſtances of that good thing are knowen and deſired of vs. We know our deliuerie, out of the goſpel. 1.

By aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto it, and that out of the goſpel: becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel alone doth promiſe deliuerie vnto thoſe that beleeue in Chriſt.

                        <note place="margin">Why the knowledge of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> 1. Becauſe no man can doe anie thing gratefull vnto God, except he firſt know what is grateful vnto him: For he wilbe worſhipped, and haue vs gratefull vnto him, not after that maner which wee will but which himſelfe hath preſcribed. Except therefore thou knowe, what is gratefull vnto him, thou ſhalt reape thence no comfort. 2. Becauſe there is firſt of all true conſolation, where there is thankfulnes: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou be thankful, thou canſt not applie vnto thy ſelfe the merit of the Sonne of God. For it is offered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied onely to vs being thankful: now thou canſt not ſhewe thankfulneſſe, except thou knowe after what maner the Lord beſtoweth on vs his benefites. 3. The knowlege of our thankfulneſſe is required neceſſarily, becauſe it is the chiefe ende and ſcope of our deliuery:<note place="margin">1 Iohn. 3.8.</note> 
                        <hi>for this purpoſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Sonne of God, that he might deſtroie the workes of the diuel.</hi> 4. That we may know that thoſe thinges which we doe are no merit, but onely a declaring of our thankfulnes. And what thou giueſt thankes for, that thou knoweſt that thou haſt not deſerued. 5. By this thankfulnes our faith &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is confirmed in vs. <hi>Obiection.</hi> That which of it ſelfe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, is not neceſſarie to be taught. But thankfulnes muſt needes follow of it ſelfe: Therefore it is not neceſſarie to be taught. <hi>Aunſwere.</hi> Thankfulnes followeth deliuerie. But not the maner of thankfulnes likewiſe: for of this we are to bee inſtructed out of the word of God. Furthermore that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not vniuerſally true: for a thing may be taught, which of it ſelfe doth greatlie followe, for greater and fuller knowledge and confirmation. Now thankfulnes it ſelfe we know, 1. Out of the Goſpel; becauſe it promiſeth deliuerie, with a condition of repentance. 2. Out of the Law, becauſe the Law in ſpeciall doth declare and determine the kindes of obedience. Seeing that then the true, ſure and onely comfort of the faithful is the ſcope of the whole doctrine of chriſtianity: &amp; ſeeing that to that comfort theſe three are neceſſarily required, that is, The conſideration of mans miſerie, of his deliuerie, and of his thankfulnes: it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that theſe three are the chiefe partes of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.

            <p>Now remaineth the Minor Propoſition, which is, <hi>But I haue not abidden in al,</hi> that is, I haue neither loued god nor my neighbour as I ought: whence the concluſion ariſeth: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am accurſed:</hi> and ſo it appeareth that indeed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our miſerie and of our puniſhment, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder the name of miſerie, is drawen out of the Law.

For <hi>perſeuerance in ſinnes</hi> is nothing elſe, than the ſinnes themſelues, which are continued vnto the end, &amp; therfore this is the meaning of the Minor: Sinnes, in which men perſeuere without repentaunce vnto the end, are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them who perſeuere in them. But now all men doe not perſeuere in them, as they perſeuere in the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, euen whoſoeuer once fal into it.

Here are we to remember againe the fall of our father Adam. <hi>God made Adam to his owne image, and ſimilitude,</hi> that is, he made him moſt good, vncorrupt, holy, righteous, and immortall: hee furniſhed him with moſt excellent giftes, that nothing might be wanting vnto him to all bleſſednes in God. Wherefore his vnderſtanding was wholy diuine: his will moſt free and moſt holy, hee had power of dooing good and euill: a law was giuen him of God, which ſhewed him what he ſhould doe, or what he ſhould not doe. For the Lord ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eate of the fruite of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both of good and euill.</hi> God ſimply required of him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and faith, and that whole Adam ſhould depende of him, and that not conſtrained by neceſſitie, but ſhoulde doe it freely. <hi>God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counſel,</hi> ſaying: <hi>If thou wilt thou ſhalt obſerue the commandements, and teſtifie thy good will.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Serpent tempted man, and counſailed him to taſt of the forbidden tree, man was not ignoraunt that the counſaile of the Serpent did not agree with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. The Lorde compelled him not: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Satan compell him in the Serpent. For God had ſaid: <hi>Ye ſhall not eate of that tree, neither ſhall ye touch it, least ye die.</hi> Wherefore it was in the hand of his counſaile, to eat or not to eate. God declared vnto him his will, plainely charging him, that he ſhould not eate, and adding the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, he did withdraw him from eating, <hi>leaſt perhaps thou die.</hi> Satan alſo, as neither coulde hee, did not vſe any force: but did probably moue him vnto it, &amp; at length did ouercome him. For when the will of the woman declined to the word of the Deuill, her minde departed from the worde of God, and reiecting a good lawe, ſhe committeth an euill worke: afterwardes ſhe drewe on her husband willingly following her to bee partaker of her ſinne.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19538:60"/>
which moued the will of man, that is: <hi>the falſe commendation of the Deuill,</hi> and euen a mere lie, and the delectable ſhewe and ſightlines of the tree.

For this ſinne wee bring with vs in our nature out of our mothers wombe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this life. <hi>I was borne in iniquitie, and in ſinne hath my mother conceiued me.</hi> And of the Deuill Chriſt ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Hee hath beene a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth: becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lie then ſpeaketh he of his owne: for he is a lier, and the father thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this may be added this reaſon: that <hi>ſinne cannot be a proper &amp; natural effect of any cauſe but of that which hath power to doe againſt the law.</hi> But this no nature hath power to doe,<note place="margin">Sinne the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of a reaſonable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the law.</note> beſides the nature of Angels, and of men: For God is a law vnto himſelfe, and can not doe or intend any thing againſt his lawe.

                     <p>So alſo we anſwere to that Argument: <hi>The priuation or want of righteouſnes and diuine wiſedome god inflicteth as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vpon men: but that priuation is ſinne.

Wherefore to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is the ſame that to will, and by a conſequent God when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſinne, doth will ſinne.</hi> We denie the conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not a ſufficient enumeratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuerſities of will in the Minor, <hi>for God is ſaid to will, &amp; not to will a thing after two waies.</hi> Either to will, as when together he both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth &amp; worketh a thing, or as he liketh a thing onely, (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which alſo is comprehended his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding) but doth not worke it.

In like ſort the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of man, or participation or fruition of god, as alſo the knowledge of god, is a propertie and part of the image of god in man, in reſpect of the beginning, when man by his creation beganne both to bee, and to bee iuſt and bleſſed: it is the ende of man in reſpect of continuance &amp; perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that is, as god created man wiſe, iuſt, and bleſſed for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19538:73"/>
this, that hee ſhoulde continue ſo for euer: that is, man was created iuſt and happie, &amp; he was created for this, that he might be iuſt and happie. Wherefore albeit the exiſtence of bleſſedneſſe and the continuance &amp; abiding of the ſame are the ſame in the thing it ſelfe: yet in conſideration and reſpect they are diuers. By reaſon of which diuers reſpects, felicitie, wiſedome, holines, are both a qualitie and an end of man, that is, are referred to the queſtions, WHAT and FOR WHAT man was created.</p>
                  <p>This firſt creation of man is diligently to be compared with the miſerie of mankinde, as alſo the end for which we were created with the aberration and ſwaruing from the end: that ſo by this meanes alſo wee may know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our miſerie. For howe much the greater wee ſee the good was, which wee haue loſt; ſo much the greater wee know the euils to be, into which we are fallen.</p>

Wherefore it is not the immutabilitie and operation of the diuine will and prouidence, which is againſt this libertie, but a priuation and conſtrainte of iudgement, which is an impulſion or a motion proceeding not from an inwarde cauſe or facultie, but onely from an outwarde cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide or againſt the nature of that which is mooued.

For the facultie or abilitie and power of the will cannot be brought into act, that is, to ſhewe and expreſſe it ſelfe, without an obiect; and, <hi>We are, liue and mooue in God,</hi> Acts. 17.

Wherefore either ſo many manifeſt places of ſcripture muſt be denied, or openly corrupted; or it muſt be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that one and the ſame action of the will is free &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent in reſpect of the will, and neceſſary in reſpect of Gods gouernment.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of the Maior in this argument is, for that GOD ſo mooueth the ſecond cauſes, and by them bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to paſſe what hee will, that in the meane ſeaſon by his prouidence hee dooth not deſtroy or aboliſh their nature, which hee gaue them at their creation, but rather preſerueth, and nouriſheth it; ſo that as concerning their nature, ſome woorcke contingently, ſome neceſſarily, although in reſpect of the libertie of Gods purpoſe, all woorke contingently, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the vnchaungeableneſſe of his decreee, all woork neceſſarily ſo as they doe. For when GOD by the riſing of the Sunne lighteneth the woorlde, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the Sunne ſo, as if beeing riſen it did not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily lighten, or were apt by nature not to lighten: and yet is it in the power of God, either to chaunge the nature of the Sunne, or, that remaining as it is, not to lighten the woorlde: as hee ſhewed in Aegypt, and at the paſſion of Chriſt. In like manner, when the Quailes light at the Tentes of the Iſraelites, and the Rauens carrie meate to Elias, and one Sparrowe falleth on the ground, GOD doth not make the nature of theſe liuing creatures ſuch, as coulde not bee carried elſe-where: and yet that they can haue no other motion than that which they haue, by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19538:84"/>
reaſon of the will of God interpoſed and comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, the Scripture plainly affirmeth. Whereof it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that as in other thinges which work contingently, their contingency, ſo in the wil the liberty which is giuen it of God, is not taken away but rather preſerued by gods gouernment.</p>
                  <p>Nowe then, if our aduerſaries in their argument vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that <hi>Liberty</hi> which conſiſteth in the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the minde, and free aſſent of the wil, wee doe not onely graunt, but alſo better mainetaine than they, the liberty of will in all actions thereof: and ſo the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior of their argument ſhall bee falſe, to witte, that thoſe things which are done by the vnchaungeable decree of God, are not done by the free will of men and Angels. For this libertie the prouidence of God doth ſo not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but rather eſtabliſh and confirme, that without this that liberty cannot ſo much as be: for God both keepeth his order which he appointed at the creation by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall efficacy and operation, and doth inſpire into all by his vertue true notions and right election. But if they challenge a libertie vnto the creatures depending of no other cauſe whereby it is guided, wee denie their whole argument, as knowing ſuch a liberty of creatures to ſtand againſt the whole Scripture, and that it only agreeth vnto God. <hi>For him alone doe al things ſerue: In him we liue and moue,</hi> and haue our being: he giueth vnto al not only life or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mouing themſelues, but euen breathing too, that is, very mouing it ſelfe.</p>

For it is able not only to withſtand God mouing it, but alſo of it owne proper motion to aſſent and obey him.

For they diſagree from the law, not as they are ordained by, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the wil of god (for thus far they agree very wel with the iuſtice and Law of God) but as they are done by men, or Diuels: and that by reaſon of this defect; becauſe either they doe not know the will of god when they doe it, or are not moued by the ſight &amp; knowledge therof to do it; that is, they doe it not to that end, that they maie obey God, who will ſo haue it. For whatſoeuer is doone to this ende, it diſagreeth not from the Lawe: ſeeing the Law doth not but with this condition either commaund
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19538:85"/>
or forbid any thing, if God hath not commanded a man to doe otherwiſe. So doth the Lawe of God forbidde to kill anie man, except whome God hath commaunded anie to kil. Who then killeth a man, God not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, hee out of doubt doth, and offendeth againſt the Lawe. Neither doth God diſſent from himſelfe or his law, when he wil haue ſome thing done either by his reueiled, or ſecret will, otherwiſe than according to the generall rule preſcribed by himſelfe in his Law. For hee hath ſuch endes and cauſes of all his purpoſes, as that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but moſt exactlie agree with his nature and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly they obiect: <hi>Libertie which is guided of another can not be an image of that liberty which dependeth of no other, which is in god. But the liberty of mans will, is the image of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which is in god. Therefore the liberty of mans will depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not or is not guided by the will of god.</hi> We denie the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior. For ſeeing that euerie thing which is like is not the ſame with that vnto which it is like, to conceiue in ſome ſort the libertie of God, it is enough that reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe woorke vpon deliberation and free election of will, albeit this election in the creatures is both guided by themſelues and another, in God by no other than by his owne diuine wiſedome. The image of a thing is not the thing it ſelfe: and the inequality of degrees ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not awaie the image, as neither the likeneſſe and ſimilitude of ſome partes taketh awaie the diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of others. Wherefore the libertie of reaſonable creatures both is gouerned of God, and is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a certaine image of the libertie which is in God, becauſe it chooſeth thinges once knowen vnto it by her own and free or voluntary motion. For as of other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or properties, ſo alſo of libertie it is impoſſible that the degrees ſhould bee equall in God and his creatures: whereas all thinges are infinite in God, and finite in his creatures. Seeing therefore wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, in the creatures is the image of the vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſedom, righteouſnes &amp; power which is in god: a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of liberty agreeable and competent for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be the image of the liberty which is in God.</p>

The good Angels by reaſon of the wiſedome and rightnes of their iudgement, and of the great and conſtant propenſion or readineſſe of their will to that, which they knowe to bee good and right, cannot will euill and vniuſt thinges, but onely thinges good and honeſt; and yet notwithſtanding they moſt freely chooſe and doe thoſe thinges which are iuſt. Right ſo, men by reaſon of their inbred ignoraunce, and corrupt iudgement of thoſe thinges which are to be done, and of the ende, as alſo by reaſon of the ſtubbornnes and frowardnes of their will, can will onely thoſe thinges which are euill: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they followe and purſue with exceeding willingnes and pleaſure, vntill they are regenerated by Gods ſpirite.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Why the will in the regenerate vſeth liberty not onely to good, but to euil alſo.</note> The cauſes for which the will vſeth her libertie not onely to the chooſing of good, but of euill alſo, are in number two. The firſt, for that in this life the renewing of our nature is not perfect, neither as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the knowledge of GOD, neither as concerning our inclinations to obey GOD: and therefore in the beſt men, while they liue here, remaine ſtil many and great ſinnes both originall and others.

Firſt theſe and the like ſpeeches ſpeake of that perfection which is not of degrees, but of partes, or of the integritie and ſyncerity of the obedience begun in them. <hi>Perfection of degrees,</hi> or obedience perfect in degrees, is that which hath not onely all the parts of obedience, but that degree alſo, which the law requireth in vs. Such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection haue not the regenerate in this life: They haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede all the partes of obedience begun in them, but yet weakely, ſo that they are here daily more and more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but attaine not to the chiefe and due degree thereof vntill they inioy the life to come. <hi>The perfection of partes</hi> is the integrity of obedience, or whole obedience, begun ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the whole law: or, it is a deſire and endeuor to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay God, and withſtand corrupt luſtes, according not to ſome only, but to al the commandements of his lawe. The <hi>perfection of ſecuritie,</hi> is a deſire or ſtudie of obedience and godlineſſe, not fained, but true and earneſt, albeit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bee wanting to the partes, as touching the degree. This perfection, to wit, both the integritie and ſyncerity of obedience, is in al the regenerate. For vnto them is it proper, to ſubmit themſelues to the commaundementes of God, euen to all without exception, and to beginne in this life all the partes of true godlineſſe, or obedience. This is called alſo <hi>the iuſtice of a good conſcience,</hi> becauſe it is a neceſſarie effect of faith, and pleaſeth God through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And albeit in all men, euen in the moſt holy, much hypocriſie remaineth, as it is ſaide, <hi>Euerie man is a lyer:</hi> yet there is a great difference betweene them, who are wholy hypocrites, and pleaſe themſelues in their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, hauing no beginning or feeling of true godlineſſe in their hearts, and thoſe, who acknowledging and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the remnantes of hypocriſie which are in them, haue withal the beginnings of true faith and conuerſion vnto God. Thoſe hypocrites are condemned of GOD: theſe are receiued into fauour, not for this beginning of obedience in them, but for the perfect obedience of Chriſt which is imputed vnto them. And therefore to this declaration or expoſition, another is alſo to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19538:100"/>
That they who are conuerted are perfect in the ſight of God, not onely in reſpect of the partes of true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which all are begunne in them, but alſo in reſpect of the degrees of the true and perfect righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed vnto them: As it is ſaid, Coloſſ. 2.10. <hi>Yee are compleate in him.</hi> Heb. 10.14. <hi>With one offering hath he conſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified.</hi> But they reply, <hi>that the perfection alſo of degrees is attributed vnto the Saintes in the Scripture.</hi> 1. Corint. 2. verſ. 6. <hi>Wee ſpeak wiſedome among them that are perfect.</hi> 1. Cor. 14. <hi>Be perfect in vnderſtanding.</hi> Eph. 4. verſ. 13. <hi>Till we all meete together in the vnity of faith and knowledge of the Sonne of God, vnto a perfect man, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meaſure of the age, of the fulneſſe of Christ.</hi> But theſe places alſo doe not call them perfect, in reſpect of the Law of God, that is, in reſpect of that degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obedience which the Law requireth in vs: but in reſpect of the weaker, who haue leſſe light and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and readines, confirmed by vſe and exerciſe to obey God, to reſiſt carnall luſtes, and to bear the croſſe. For ſo is this perfection expounded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>That we be no more children, wandering and carried about with euerie wind of doctrine.</hi> Philip. 3.12. <hi>Not as though I had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die attained to it, or were already perfect.</hi> They oppoſe againſt theſe aunſweres a place out of 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. verſ. 17. <hi>Herein is the loue perfect in vs, that we ſhould haue boldneſſe in the daie of iudgement for as he is, euen ſo are we in this woorld. There is no feare in Loue, but perfect Loue casteth out feare, for feare hath painfulneſſe: and hee that feareth is not perfect in Loue.</hi> But Saint Iohn meaneth not that our Loue towardes GOD, but Gods Loue towards vs is perfect, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and fully knowen vnto vs by the effects or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of GOD beſtowed vpon vs in Chriſt;<note place="margin">Our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; newnes of life doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs of our iuſtification, as being an effect thereof.</note> or as Saint Paul ſpeaketh, <hi>Roman.</hi> 5. Where hee ſaith, <hi>that the Loue of GOD ſhed abroad in our heartes, by the holy Ghost, is the cauſe,</hi> why wee doe without feare, and with bouldneſſe expect the day of iudgement: And of this mercy and free Loue of GOD towards vs hee ſignifieth, that by this token or teſtimonie wee are aſſured, becauſe in this life wee are refourmed by the holy ſpirite to his image.

not as by the cauſe, of the effect, but as by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, of the cauſe. Nowe though regeneration be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life, yet if it bee indeede begun, it ſufficeth for the confirmation and proouing of the truth of our faith vnto our conſciences. And theſe very words, which S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Aunſwere. If the concluſion of this reaſon bee rightly meant, the whole reaſon may be graunted, to wit, <hi>that the regenerate haue ſo far forth libertie to perſeuere, as they are ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and guided by the holie ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the libertie which they haue to chooſe good depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon his working and motion. But if it be meant that the godly haue this libertie either alwaies, or ſo, that their perſeueraunce dependeth of themſelues; there will bee

more found in the concluſion, than was in the premiſſes; and that for two cauſes.

                  <p>But here they replie:<note place="margin">The regenerate deſerue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of gods ſpirit from them through their manifold ſinnes, which yet the merit of Chriſt, and his power preſerueth in them.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is not forſaken of the holie Ghoſt, except himſelfe firſt withſtand the motion of the holie ghoſt, hath alwaies the aide and aſſiſtaunce of the holie Ghoſt readie, that hee maie perſiſt in that good which hee purpoſeth. But the godlie are not forſaken of the holie Ghoſt, vnleſſe themſelues firſt withſtand him: therefore they haue alwaies the aſſiſtance of the holie Ghoſt readie, that they may perſeuere. But hee who hath this hath in his owne power to perſeuere, or to decline: becauſe the cauſe is in his owne will alone why hee doth either obeie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the ſpirite mouing him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When wee denie the Minor of this reaſon they prooue it thus. <hi>The iuſtice of GOD doth not inflict pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but on thoſe who ſinne: but to bee forſaken of the holie Ghoſt, is a puniſhment of ſinne, and vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Therefore no man is forſaken of the holie Ghoſt, but who hath firſt deſerued that forſaking through his owne ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornes.</hi> The aunſwere hereto is double. Fisſt, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be graunted, as concerning the regenerate. For in them, as long as they are in this life, there is alwaies ſo much remaining of ſinne, as they deſerue not onely temporall, but eternall deſertion and forſaking: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, becauſe the ſinne which remaineth in them is forgiuen them for Chriſt, therefore they are freed from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet are they not free from chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſo long as the remnaunts of ſinne abide in them.</p>

As, it is in the ſecond of Samuel the twentie and fourth Chapter: <hi>And the wrath of the Lord was again kindled againſt Iſraell, and hee mooued Dauid againſt them, in that hee ſaide, Goe and number Iſraell and Iuda.</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19538:103"/>
Neither doth this immutabilitie and efficacie of Gods purpoſe take away the libertie of will, in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but rather increaſeth &amp; preſerueth it; and how much the more effectually God moueth it, with ſo much the greater propenſion, and readines it both will and doth good, which the example of the bleſſed Angels co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth. This is alſo more friuolous, that they ſay, <hi>That the godly are made careles and ſlouthfull, and the deſire to perſeuere is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in them, if they heare that their perſeueraunce dependeth of the grace of the holy ſpirite alone.</hi> For we may very well inuert this and returne it vpon our aduerſaries: ſeeing nothing doth more giue an edge vnto the ſaints and thoſe who are indeed godly, to a deſire and indeuour to beware of falling, and to a daily and earneſt calling vpon God, than if they knowe, that they cannot ſo much as one moment ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tentations of the Diuel and their fleſhe, except by the vertue and inſtinct of the holy ſpirite they bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen from euill, and bee forceably moued to good: but contrariwiſe that opinion as experience teacheth, maketh men careles and leſſe minding to beware of ſin, by which men imagine that it is in their owne power, to depart from god, liſtening a while and yeelding to their owne luſts, and to returne againe to God, as oft as themſelues thinke good ſo to doe. Now if ſo bee this ſentence concerning true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance depending of the grace of the holy ſpirite, breed in the reprobate and prophane men a careleſneſſe and contempt of God; it is both fooliſh and iniurious, to iudge of the elect and godly by their humour, or for their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes to hide and ſmoother the truth.

                     <hi>The fourth degree of libertie is in man perfectlie regenerated after his glorification,</hi> or after this life. In this libertie the will ſhalbe only free to chooſe good, and not to chooſe euill: &amp; this ſhalbe the perfect libertie of our wil, by which we ſhall not only not ſin, but ſhall abhorre nothing more than ſin, &amp; alſo ſhal not be able to ſin anie more. The reaſons hereof are theſe. <hi>Becauſe in the mind ſhal ſhine the perfect knowledge of god &amp; his will, in the wil &amp; heart a moſt perfect &amp; exceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to obeie god, an exceeding loue of god, &amp; a ioy reſting in god, &amp; an agreeablenes or conformitie with god.</hi> Wherefore no place ſhalbe for ignorance, for errour, or any doubting of God, yea or for the leaſt ſtubbornes againſt God.

For which cauſe it cannot poſſiblie bee, that any motions or actions

                     <note place="margin">This laſt degree of libertie after mans glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on greater than the firſt before his fall, becauſe this excludeth all poſſibility of falling, the other did not.</note> Neither by this meanes is the libertie of will taken away, or diminiſhed, but is truely confirmed and perfected in the bleſſed Angels &amp; men: for as much as both the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is free from al error, ignorance, and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and lightened with the perfect knowledge of god; and the heart and wil free from all ſtubbornes, and without all ſoliciting or ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to withſtand god, is carried with an exceeding loue of god, and an alacrity to obey the knowen will of god.

The reaſon alſo, why the paines and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of ſins ſhould be eternal &amp; infinit, is euident: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>for ſin committed againſt the infinit good, an infinit puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is iuſtlie exacted:</hi> neither coulde there be made by anie temporall puniſhment of a meere creature ſufficient ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction vnto gods infinit &amp; eternal iuſtice: &amp; therefore the temporal puniſhment of Chriſt, that it might be ſufficient to deliuer the elect, was to be equiualent to eternall pains.</p>
                     <p>Here the Epicures obiect: <hi>He that is exceeding mercifull,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in inflicting eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                        <hi>cannot behold the eternal torments of his creatures, much leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſuch on them. God is exceeding merciful; becauſe his mercie doth far exceed our ſins: Therefore he doth not ſuffer his creatures to remain in eternal torments.</hi> Anſw. The Maior is true, when exceeding &amp; moſt exact iuſtice, ſuch as is in god, doth not exact, &amp; require that exceeding ſinne haue exceeding pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Replie. <hi>Exceeding ſtrict iuſtice doth not ſtand with exceeding mercie: becauſe that admitteth no mitigating equabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. In God is exceeding iuſtice, therefore not exceeding mercie.</hi> Anſw. Both the Maior, and the proofe thereof is falſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, puniſhing of his exceeding iuſtice our ſin with exceeding puniſhment, doth notwithſtanding ſhewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding equability and fauorablenes, whiles he tranſlateth the puniſhment thereof from vs, &amp; laieth it vpon his ſonne. They frame alſo the ſame reply on this wiſe: <hi>With him, that followeth extreme or ſtrict iuſtice, mercie and equabilitie hath no place. But god in puniſhing ſinnes foloweth ſtrict iuſtice. Therfore he is not merciful.</hi> To which we anſwer. 1. that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior is falſe in reſpect of him, who for his wiſedome knoweth means to mitigate puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or to exerciſe mercy, as that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19538:107"/>
notwithſtanding his iuſtice may remaine inuiolated, and himſelfe bee ſatisfied. So god doth execute extreame and exquiſite iuſtice in puniſhing our ſinnes, ſhewing neuertheleſſe exceeding and maruelous equabilitie and lenity, while hee puniſheth them in his Sonne, and not in vs. And therefore one degree of mercie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, doth not ſtraight enforce the deniall of others. God puniſheth ſinne in the reprobate with eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: &amp; yet is he merciful, while he is not delighted with the death of him that dieth: but doth by differring, and mitigating the puniſhment, and by beſtowing benefites inuite all men to repentance. When a Iudge putteth a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to death, he executeth extreame iuſtice: yet may he be mercifull withall, if hee reioice not at the deſtruction of the man, but had rather hee were ſaued, if ſo the lawe permitted.</p>

                        <hi>Temporall afflictions</hi> belong to both: both vnto the godly and to the reprobate. Theſe are either puniſhments, or the Croſſe. The puniſhment, is either deſtruction or torment inflicted by order of iuſtice on the perſon giltie of ſinne.

                     <p>For they are not according to iuſtice inflicted, to bee any ſatisfaction or recompence for their ſinnes: but according to mercie, for their amendment and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. For by theſe chaſtiſementes they are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of the anger of GOD againſt ſinnes, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment, which GOD will inflict on them, if they repent not. Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Tryals.</note> 
                        <hi>The proofes and tryals</hi> of their faith, hope, inuocation, feare of GOD, and patience: that the elect may goe forwarde in theſe vertues, and the ſame alſo bee made knowen to others. Such was the affliction of Iob. Thirdly, <hi>Martyrdomes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Martyrdomes.</note> which are teſtifications concerning their doctrine. For when the godly are, for the confeſſion of true doctrine, preſſed with calamities, or ſlaine, theſe afflictions are no puniſhmentes of certaine transgreſſions, but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes, whereby they teſtifie and witneſſe, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the goſpell which they profeſſe, to bee true, and doubt not to ſeale this with their bloud, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo they witneſſe that they in exceeding tormentes and death feele and haue experience of that comfort, which they did promiſe out of that doctrine, in their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vnto others.

                  <p>THis queſtion is neceſſarie. For if there be no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of vs out of miſerie, in vaine make wee que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the reſt.

                  <p>The firſt is <hi>his mercie and immeaſurable goodneſſe,</hi> which that hee woulde exerciſe in ſauing of vs, not impeaching his iuſtice, he hath vttered in his word. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The father quickeneth whom he will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <hi>his infinite wiſedome,</hi> whereby hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how to turne the purpoſes of the Diuel imagined and deuiſed to the reproche of GOD himſelfe, by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

mankinde, and to the ouerthrowing of the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods choſen, euen to the manifeſting of his owne glorie, and to the ſaluation of his choſen. God therefore, by this his wiſedome hath found out an admirable tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, and ſuch as no creature coulde haue found, of his iuſtice and mercie, in deliuering man, that is, ſuch a way, whereby hee might ſhewe his exceeding both mercie and iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>Gods omnipotencie,</hi> wherefore hee is able to performe that deliuerie of man from ſinne and death, which hee through his immeaſurable mercie, and wiſe counſaile decreed. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.37. <hi>With God nothing ſhalbee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</hi> To denie then mans deliuerie, is to ſpoile God of infinite wiſedome, goodnes, and power, againſt that which is ſaid, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Lorde bringeth downe to the graue, and raiſeth vp.</hi> Pſal. 68.20. <hi>To the Lord God belong the iſſues of death.</hi> Iſai. 59.1. <hi>The Lords hand is not ſhortened.</hi>

Therefore the caſting awaie of man from the face of god is vnchangeable, neither is it poſſible that without the impeaching of gods iuſtice and truth man ſhould eſcape euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation.</hi> Aunſwere.

the holy Ghoſt forcibly mouing our hearts to beleeue the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Here ariſeth a queſtion: <hi>Whether Adam after his fall might haue certainly promiſed himſelfe deliuerie?</hi> Wee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that hee coulde not, without eſpeciall promiſe, and reuelation. And before he had this, nothing could preſent it ſelfe vnto his mind, but the great iuſtice &amp; truth of God exacting of him euerlaſting puniſhment, for not yeelding obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For fleſh &amp; bloud reueal not thoſe things, which are the peculiar and proper benefites of the Mediatour. But ſome man may except: that the ſelfe ſame cauſes notwithſtanding doe remaine, euen nowe after the publiſhing of the Goſpell, to wit, the iuſtice and truth of GOD, who is neuer chaunged. If then Adam coulde not hope for deliuerie before the promiſe was publiſhed, neither could he after the publiſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For ſo hee might haue reaſoned: <hi>It is impoſſible that the iuſtice and truth of GOD ſhoulde bee impeached. But mans recouering and eſcaping out of puniſhment, would impeache the iuſtice and truth of GOD, becauſe euerlaſting puniſhment ſhoulde not bee inflicted on man which yet the iuſtice and truth of GOD require. For, the puniſhment to bee euerlaſting, and yet man to wade and eſcape out of it, are thinges contradictorie, and of flatte repugnauncie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mans eſcape and deliuerie out of puniſhment is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Obiection or temptation Adam might by the promiſe nowe made haue repelled on this wiſe. The Minor is true, if the eſcaping bee ſuch, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient puniſhment and equall to the ſinne bee laide neither vpon the ſinner himſelfe, nor on another who offereth himſelfe in the ſinners place. But the iuſtice of GOD hath inflicted puniſhment ſufficient for our ſinnes, on his owne Sonne who offered himſelfe of his owne accorde to ſuſtaine it for vs. Wherefore mans eſcaping out of miſerie, by the full ſatisfaction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Sonne of GOD, doth not impeache but rather eſtabliſh Gods iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>But againe it is replied: <hi>That which neceſſarilie doth not conclude puniſhment to inſue, doth leaue ſome hope,

neither willeth vs to diſpaire of deliuerie from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Hee ought not verily to haue diſpaired, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde hee haue inferred vpon his fall neceſſarily, that his deliuerie out of miſerie was ſimplie impoſſible; but neither coulde hee of the otherſide haue certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed vnto himſelfe, or hoped for it, before the publiſhing of the Goſpell. Becauſe neither hee nor any creature was able,<note place="margin">Humane reaſon might probablie coniecture, but not neceſſarily conclude mans deliuerie.</note> or ſhoulde for euer haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of himſelfe to perceiue, or ſo much as imagine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe a maner of eſcaping puniſhment, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the iuſtice of God: except GOD had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and reuealed the ſame by his Sonne. <hi>Hee might truelie</hi> (as others likewiſe, who liue out of the Church deſtitute of the worde of promiſe) <hi>haue probablie reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that one day there ſhoulde bee a deliuerie.</hi> Firſt, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not meete, that man the moſt excellent creature ſhoulde bee made of GOD to ſuſtaine the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that for euer.</hi> Againe, <hi>For that it ſeemeth not likely, that GOD woulde haue deliuered a lawe to man to no effect, that is, which ſhoulde neuer bee perfectly performed by him.</hi>

Beeing therefore reconciled vnto God by ſatisfaction moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfourmed vnto the Law, <hi>we are deliuered then from ſinne alſo,</hi> that is, from corruption it ſelfe, by regeneration, that is, by the forcible working of the holy Ghoſt, aboliſhing it in vs, and reſtoring true holines and righteouſnes, heere, by beginning it, and in the life to come alſo, by perfecting and abſoluing it.

But if it bee not perfourmed, then the Lawe exacteth puniſhment, as a ſatisfaction for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience omitted. For neither can ſatisfaction bee made by obedience, for the breach of the Lawe, or for omitting of obedience. Becauſe the obedience or Godlineſſe which followeth the breach of the Lawe, when as it is due for that preſent, when it is perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, cannot at all ſatisfie for the debt or offence or treſpaſſe which is paſt. Wherefore ſufficient puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is that ſatisfaction, which the Lawe and Gods iuſtice exacteth at our handes for the not perfourming of obedience, that wee may bee accepted and beloued of God.</p>
                  <p>This beeing ſette downe and reſolued of, further demaund is made, <hi>by whome that ſatisfaction or puniſhment is to bee perfourmed?</hi> The Lawe will haue it perfourmed by vs, and that iuſtly: but it yeeldeth not ability to perfourme it, neither any where maketh declaration thereof. But the Ghoſpell declareth and ſheweth vs Chriſt, by whome we may ſatisfie. <hi>By our ſelues wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe the Lawe requireth perfect ſatisfaction:</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:19538:126"/>
it is not perfect,<note place="margin">Our ſatisfaction can not bee by our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then it woulde bee infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> except it bee either eternall (for all ſinne is an offence againſt the infinite good: If then this infinite good muſt bee ſatisfyed, ſatisfaction muſt needes be made by eternall puniſhment, which aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth in equality to that infinite good) or elſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, yet equall to eternall, and worthie to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the iuſtice of GOD for ſatisfaction. If it bee eternall, then neuer ſhall wee bee deliuered or recouered out of puniſhment, death and ſinne beeing fullie conquered: becauſe it can neuer bee ſaide, that wee haue ſatisfyed (which implyeth the ende) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that wee are ſatisfieng (which ſheweth the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and continuing of puniſhment) which ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſuch as the puniſhment of the Diuels and reprobate men, which neuer ſhall haue an end. Nowe for a Temporall puniſhment which ſhoulde bee aunſwerable and equall to eternall, there is no man, by reaſon of manifolde imperfection who can perfourme it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>becauſe dailie wee heape vp offences and debtes,</hi> yea euen in our puniſhmentes themſelues, while wee doe not in them acknowledge God to be iuſt, and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to puniſh vs for our ſinnes, but murmur and fret againſt him. Wherefore our paines and puniſhmentes muſt needes be alſo heaped vp and encreaſed. For he, who goeth on afterwards in offending him, whom he hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore offended, can neuer haue him fauourable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Thirdly, <hi>becauſe wee cannot deſerue of God, that hee ſhoulde pardon vs our preſent ſinnes, muchleſſe our ſinnes paſt.</hi> Neither can wee pay the debt paſt, with that, which wee owe preſently. Since then wee are not able by our ſelues, wee muſt needes make ſatisfaction by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Obiection. <hi>The Lawe requireth OVR puniſhment, becauſe wee haue ſinned.</hi> Aunſwere. The Lawe requireth ours, but not excluſiuely, ſo that it doth not admit it to bee performed by another, for vs. For, albeit the Law knoweth not this ſatisfaction for our ſins made by another, &amp; to be imputed vnto vs, but the Goſpell onely reuealeth it: yet no-where dooth the Lawe either exclude or diſalowe it.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19538:127"/>
Wherefore it is not contrarie to the Lawe, that another ſhould ſatisfie for vs. Reply. <hi>But that another ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for offenders, is vniuſt.</hi> Aunſwere. That another ſhould bee puniſhed for offenders, is not diſagreeing with Gods iuſtice,<note place="margin">The conditions to bee in him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, who may bee puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for another.</note> if theſe conditions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cur withall. 1 <hi>If hee who is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, be innocent.</hi> 2 <hi>If he be of the ſame nature with the offenders.</hi> 3 <hi>If of his own accord he offer himſelfe to puniſhment.</hi> 4 <hi>If him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe be able to recouer out of puniſhment, and not inforced to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh therein.</hi> And this is the cauſe that men can not iuſtly puniſh ones offences in another, becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bring to paſſe, that the partie puniſhed ſhoulde not periſh in the puniſhment. 5 <hi>If hee wiſh and attaine vnto that ende which Chriſt reſpected, euen the glorie of GOD, and ſaluation of men.</hi>

And except his ſuffering of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had beene ſufficient, wee ſhoulde as yet remaine in our ſinnes and death.</hi> Furthermore, <hi>that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, whereby himſelfe did perfectlie keepe the Lawe,</hi> is called the fulfilling of the Lawe by obedience: <hi>and his ſuffering of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due for our ſinnes,</hi> is termed the fulfilling of the Lawe by puniſhment; likewiſe obedience perfected and abſolued in ſuffering puniſhment. And the puniſhment verily vnto which we were bound, he of his owne accord
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19538:132"/>
paied for vs, and imputeth it vnto vs, that it maie no more bee neceſſary for vs to bee ſubiect vnto euerlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But his obedience or purity of life, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loue of God and our neighbour, hee perfourmed for himſelfe, not for vs, neither dooth hee impute it vnto vs. 1. Becauſe himſelfe is bound by nature to perfourme it; in that he is man: For euery reaſonable creature, in that he is a creature, oweth perfect conformity and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Lawe and his creatour. 2. If Chriſt had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed his obedience vnto the Lawe for vs, wee ſurelie ſhould bee no longer bound vnto it: as neither is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that wee ſhould ſuſteine euerlaſting puniſhment for our ſinnes, becauſe they were once puniſhed in Chriſt. 3. The Lawe and iuſtice of God doth not exact both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that is both obedience, and puniſhment; but the one of them onely, that is, either obedience, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The third way, that Chriſt dooth fulfill the Law, <hi>is by fulfilling of it in vs, by his ſpirite,</hi> when as he regenerateth vs by it, and maketh vs able, that euen in this life we may beginne both inwarde and outwarde obedience, which the Law requireth of them who are reconciled to GOD, and may perfourme that wholy and fully in the life to come. Fourthly, <hi>hee fulfilleth the Lawe by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it, and by purging it of errors and corruptions,</hi> and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the true vnderſtanding of the Scripture or ſacred doctrine. For, as it appeareth by the Euangeliſt S. Matthew, the Scribes and Phariſies had ſo corrupted the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meaning of the Lawe, wholly reſtraining it to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily actions, that Chriſt was enforced thereby to giue the right ſenſe of manie places thereof, and ſo by the light of the trueth to ſcatter the miſt of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>that hee might bee able to ſuſtaine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wrath of GOD, or greeuouſneſſe of puniſhment, which

That there might therefore be a proportion betwixt the puniſhment of our Mediatour, and all the ſinnes of all men, which was altogether required by the infinite iuſtice of God: it was behoouefull that that perſon ſhoulde bee of infinit ſtrength, and ſo to bee GOD, who ſhould ſuffer (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling into deſpaire, or beeing brought vnto nothing) a puniſhment, finite in time, but in greatneſſe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe or valewe infinite. <hi>Nowe neceſſarilie was that puniſhment finite in reſpect of time:</hi> Becauſe, that our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour might accompliſh the benefite of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nowe, when it was perfectly merited, apply it or beſtowe it vpon vs, by his forcible working, that is, might effectually ſaue vs: it was neceſſary, that hee ſhoulde by his power overcome death, and firſt depell it and ſhake it off from himſelfe. Theſe thinges coulde not haue beene doone by a meere man, who, of what ſtrength ſoeuer hee bee, cannot by his owne force or power wraſtle out of the handes of Death.

                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is, <hi>that his puniſhment might be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and full woorthy merit and ranſome for the purging of the ſinnes euen of the whole world, and for the repairing of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and glorie which they had loſt.</hi> The worthines of this price muſt be infinit, &amp; therfore ſo muſt the perſon alſo be himſelfe, which paieth ſuch a price. For, that the creator ſuffered for the ſinnes of the woorlde, is by infinite more, than the death of al the creatures, and the conformitie or correſpondence of all the Angels and holy men with God. Wherefore the Apoſtles when they ſpeake of Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, euer almoſt make mention of his Godhead. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.28. <hi>God hath purchaſed the Church with his blood.</hi> 1.

perſon himſelfe doth declare the worthineſſe of this price, but alſo the multitude and greatneſſe of ſinnes which are committed from the beginning of the world vnto the end, among which none is ſo little, that deſerueth not euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting death, and all of them are ſo euill and grieuous, that they cannot bee expiated or doone away, no not by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall puniſhment of any creature.</p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>That he may reſtore, by his forcible operation &amp; power, the Image of God in vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is, <hi>That he ſhould make knowen vnto vs the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wil of God, concerning the receiuing of mankind againe into fauor.</hi> For of this except he were God, himſelfe ſhould bee ignorant, &amp; ſo ſhould not be able to reueale it vnto others. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at anie time, the onlie begotten Sonne, which is in the boſome of the Father, hee hath declared him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fift is, <hi>That he might giue the holie ghoſt, by whome hee might beſtowe on vs, mantaine and perfect in vs the benefits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his death, to wit, remiſſion of ſinnes, righteouſneſſe, new obedience, and life euerlaſting.</hi> For it is not ſufficient for our Mediatour to make interceſſion for vs, to be made a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to open and manifeſt the decree of God, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie alſo, that he promiſe in our behalfe, that wee ſhall embrace the decree concerning our redemption by our mediator, and ceaſe at length to offend God through our ſinnes: which is the other part of the couenant, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs, and is performed by vs, that the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may remaine firme and ratified.

For vnto them alſo was the ſame grace effectually applied by Chriſt and for Chriſt, but beeing as yet to be manifeſted in the fleſh, and therefore more ſparingly. Whatſoeuer grace and true knowledge of God was euer in any men, they had it by Chriſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time, the only begotten ſon, which is in the boſom of the father, he hath declared him.</hi> Reply. <hi>But hee ſaith, The Law by Moſes: therefore not the goſpel.</hi> Anſwere. The conſequence is of no force which is inferred from the manner of handling a thing to the thing it ſelfe. As, Moſes doth compriſe and deliuer the goſpell in dark and ſparing maner: Therefore he doth not at al meddle with it: This conſequence is not of force.

                     <note place="margin">What hiſtorical faith is.</note>THe difference of theſe kindes one from the other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth out of their definitions. <hi>Hiſtoricall faith, is to know and think al thoſe thinges to bee true, which are manifeſted from aboue, either by voice, or by viſions, or by any other manner of reuelation, and are taught in the bookes of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, and thus to be perſuaded of them for the aſſeueration and teſtimonie of god himſelfe.</hi> It is called <hi>hiſtoricall,</hi> becauſe it is a bare knowledge, of ſuch thinges, as God ſaith hee dooth, or hath done, or hereafter wil doe. Of this faith theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of holy Scripture make mention. <hi>Iames</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Diuels beleeue, and tremble.</hi> For the Diuel knoweth exactly, both what things are written in the woorde, and alſo what are not written. Becauſe he is a ſpirit, witty, quick, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: hee is preſent and ſeeth whatſoeuer things are doone in the church, &amp; alſo through long experience hath known &amp; doth know the doctrin of the church to be true, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>If I haue al faith, ſo that I moue mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains &amp;c.</hi> Which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be conſtred of al the ſorts of faith, Iuſtifing faith only excepted. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>Simon Magus is ſaid to haue beleeued,</hi> to wit, that the doctrine was true, which the Apoſtles did propound.<note place="margin">Hiſtorical faith good in it ſelfe, but made ill by them, who can not applie it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues.</note> Wherefore <hi>hiſtoricall faith, may be without iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng faith, although iuſtifieng faith is not without it:</hi> for the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical is a part of the iuſtifieng: &amp; therefore this is good and profitable, and neceſſarie in it ſelfe, but is made in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and men ſinne by an accident, for that they apply not thoſe thinges to themſelues, which they knowe out of the word of God.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie faith is.</note>
                     <hi>Temporarie faith, is to aſſent vnto the heauenly doctrine which is deliuered by the Prophets and Apoſtles, to profeſſe it, and to reioice in the knowledge thereof, and to glory therein for a time, yet not for any feeling of gods grace towardes them, but for other cauſes whatſoeuer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Temporarie faith is lead in a ſtring with the commodities of this world, and with them doth liue and die.</note> 
                     <hi>and therefore without any true conuerſion, and finall perſeuerance in the profeſſion of that doctrine.</hi> This faith or approbation of Gods truth, and ioy therein, is not true, ſound and perpetual, but only dureth for a ſeaſon, becauſe it ariſeth and dependeth of temporary cauſes, which may bee changed and taken away; as the deſire and pleaſure of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19538:145"/>
knowledge, glory, honours, and other worldly commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether publick or priuate, true, or apparant &amp; in ſhew. Theſe commodities being gone once, and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſome other temptation ariſing, it muſt needs be alſo that this faith muſt fail. This definition is drawn from the words of Chriſt: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Hee that receiueth ſeede in the ſtony ground, is he which heareth the word, and incontinently with ioie receiueth it,</hi> that is, embraceth and profeſſeth it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioiceth in it: <hi>yet hath he no roote in himſelfe,</hi> that is, hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth applying of the merit of Chriſt &amp; confidence therein, and the regeneration of the holy ghoſt. Wherefore it is only a reſemblance and ſhew of godlines, not true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and faith. It differeth from hiſtorical faith, 1. <hi>For that this temporarie doth fore put hiſtoricall.</hi> Further, <hi>it addeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto knowledge, as profeſſion of doctrine and a certaine god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, gladneſſe and glorying or reioicing, becauſe of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, but at length it ſaileth. Hiſtorical faith is onely aknowledge.</hi> This difference is thereby confirmed, in that the Diuels haue hiſtoricall faith: for they beleeue &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but they haue not this Temporarie faith. Firſt, <hi>becauſe that knowledge and faith, which they haue, neuer faileth or is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but remaineth in them perpetually.</hi> Againe, <hi>neither ioy they in their knowledge, neither doe they profeſſe it: but though they know it to be true, yet do they horribly perſecute it, and would haue it wholy rooted out.</hi> Now if any man had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this temporary faith vnder hiſtoricall, I am not againſt it. But then muſt degrees be made of hiſtoricall faith, to wit, that in ſome it is ioined with a certaine ieioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and profeſſion, as in thoſe who reuoult from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church and godlineſſe: in others not ſo, as in the Diuels and damned perſons: and ſo the matter commeth all to one. Obiection. <hi>But the Diuel hath often profeſſed Chriſt; therefore he doth not oppugne his doctrine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Diuel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt, that for his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſake, he might the leſſe bee beleeued.</note> Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.

                     <hi>The faith of Miracles is an eſpecial gift of working miracles, that is, it is a certaine perſuaſion, ſpringing from an eſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation and promiſe of god, whereby a man firmelie reſolueth, that ſome extraordinary or miraculous woorke, and contrarie to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall come to paſſe by gods power, which hee hath foretolde or woulde haue to bee doone in the name of God and Ieſus Christ.</hi> This kinde of faith is prooued out of the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.2. <hi>If I had all faith, ſo that I could remooue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines &amp;c.</hi> For although this ſpeech bee vnderſtoode of all the kindes of faith, excepting iuſtifieng faith, yet is it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially referred to the faith of Miracles: as Chriſt alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Faith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by ſpeciall reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.20. <hi>If ye haue faith as much as a grain of mustard ſeede, ye ſhal ſaie vnto this mountaine,</hi> Remoue &amp;c. <hi>That this faith is diuerſe from the other kindes,</hi> neither to bee drawen ſimply out of the word of god, but by an eſpecial reuelation of god comming thereto, without which miracles cannot be wrought, we prooue by theſe reaſons. 1. <hi>By that ſaying of Chriſt, If ye haue faith as much as a grain of muſtard ſeede:</hi> But manie holie men, who both knewe the hiſtorie of Gods woorde, and reioyced therein, and applyed it vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, had faith: yet did they not remooue mountaines. Therefore this is a diuers kind of faith, from that which they had. 2 <hi>Many endeuored to caſt out Diuels without anie reuelation from aboue, as the Sonnes of Sceua.</hi> Act. 19.14. With whom it fell out ill; the ſpirite of the poſſeſſed man inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, diſarming and wounding them. 3 <hi>Simon Magus</hi> Acts. 8.13. <hi>is ſaide to haue beleeued, and yet could hee not woorke miracles:</hi> and therefore he would haue bought and gotten this power with mony. 4 <hi>The Diuell knoweth the ſtorie of the Scripture, neither yet dooth hee woorke miracles:</hi> becauſe none beſides the Creatour is able to chaunge the nature of thinges. 5 <hi>Iudas did woorke miracles, and yet,</hi> Ioh. 6.70. <hi>hee is ſaide of the Lorde to bee a Diuell,</hi> that is, not to haue a iuſtifieng faith. He had therefore ſome other faith, to

witte, the faith of Miracles, Hiſtoricall, and perhaps alſo Temporarie faith. So, <hi>Matthewe.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Manie ſhall ſaie vnto Christ: Haue wee not by thy name caſt out Diuels? But CHRIST will aunſwere them, I neuer knewe you.</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore this gift of woorcking miracles is giuen to hypocrits alſo.

                     <note place="margin">What Iuſtifieng faith is.</note> as it is deſcribed out of the word of God in the 21. queſtion of the Catechiſme, is, <hi>not onelie steedfastlie to aſſent to euerie woorde of GOD, and in this alſo to the promiſe of grace for Christes merit, but alſo a confidence, and full perſwaſion, applieng to euerie one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> that is, whereby euerie man in his minde is fully and certainely perſwaded, that not onely others, but himſelfe alſo hath God fauorable vnto him, according to the promiſe of grace, and therefore reioiceth in God, and ouercommeth all penſiueneſſe and feare.<note place="margin">The differences of Iuſtifieng faith from the reſt.</note> 
                     <hi>This differeth from the other kindes of faith,</hi> in that this onely is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine confidence, whereby wee apply Chriſtes merit vnto our ſelues.

It is a motion of the heart,</hi> becauſe it is a following and purſuing of a good thing, &amp; a deſire of retaining that good, which a man already doth enioy. <hi>It is reioicing,</hi> becauſe it is glad of the preſent grace of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes euerie of vs, of full deliuerance from the gilt of ſin, &amp; from ſinne it ſelfe in part; &amp; becauſe by that which euery one enioyeth in preſent, hee conceiueth euerlaſting hope of bleſſings to come, as of euerlaſting life, &amp; of ful deliuery from al euill both of crime and paine, and therefore is free from the feare of future euill. <hi>To him that hath ſhall bee giuen.

of our full redemption.</hi> 2. Corinth. 1.22. and 5.5. Epheſ. 1.13.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>iuſtifieng faith differeth from the reſt, in this alſo, that this iuſtifieng faith is concerning all ſpirituall giftes, and whatſoeuer belong to our ſaluation,</hi> and is properly and ſimply or abſolutely called faith in the Scripture: and is proper alſo and peculiar to the elect and choſen. <hi>The faith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is of a certaine gift,</hi> whereby we are not bettered, which we may want without any hinderaunce to our ſaluation: neither is it giuen to al the faithful; nor at al times. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall faith is a part of the Iuſtifieng,</hi> and befalleth to al both the godly, and hypocrits, but is not ſufficient alone to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, becauſe it applieth not to it ſelfe thoſe benefits which are knowen vnto it out of the word. <hi>Temporary faith hypocrites haue.</hi> Iuſtifieng faith therefore comprehendeth hiſtoricall, but this is not ſufficient to make a iuſtifieng faith, as neither are the other two. For, <hi>If the inheritance be of faith,</hi> that faith then ſhal be one of theſe foure: <hi>But it is not of hiſtoricall faith:</hi> otherwiſe the Diuels alſo ſhoulde bee heirs. <hi>Neither of temporary,</hi> for that is reiected by Chriſt: <hi>Nor of the faith of miracles;</hi> if ſo, Iudas alſo ſhould be heire. The inheritaunce therefore is of iuſtifieng faith, which is properly called <hi>faith. The more general or material cauſe of faith, is a knowledge and aſſent.</hi> For, if we ſpeak properly, we are not ſaid to aſſent vnto a doctrine which we know not. <hi>The difference or formall cauſe is, to apply the promiſe of grace once known, and as it were to claim it for him that knoweth it.</hi> For this cauſeth faith to be, and to be called iuſtifieng. <hi>The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or part of man wherein it remaineth, is the heart or will. The peculiar affection, or property of it, is to reſt &amp; ioy in God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is diſtinguiſhed from all the other ſorts of faith. <hi>The holy ſpirit is the principall efficient cauſe thereof. Inſtrumentall cauſes, are the word and Sacramentes.</hi> Furthermore, <hi>what iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng faith is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng faith is, but hee that hath it.</note>

them in producing and bringing forth the ſame externall woorke. A more open declaration hereof may be this. The woorkes of our creation, redemption, &amp; ſanctification, are <hi>the operations of the Godhead outwardly,</hi> that is, externall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which God worketh on his creatures: <hi>and they are vndiuided,</hi> that is, common to the three perſons, which they by common wil and power woork in the creatures, by reaſon of that one and the ſame eſſence and nature of the Godhead, which they haue.

As therefore he that begetteth is one perſon, &amp; hee another that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: In like maner the holy ghoſt alſo is another perſon from the father &amp; the ſon, from whom he from euerlaſting ineffably is produced, or hath his being, by proceeding or iſſuing: yet for al this there is but one and the ſame diuine eſſence of theſe three perſons, albeit the father, as the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Firſt therefore, whereas the ſcripture ſaith,<note place="margin">How all thinges are ſaide to bee of God.</note> 
                     <hi>that al things are of god:</hi> Rom. 11.1. Cor. 8. it doth not mean that al things are god, or the eſſence of god, or propagated from it.

This is not meant of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the diuine ſubſtance, as if the ſoul were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from the eſſence of god, but of the ſimilitude of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, &amp; of the creation. The ſoule therefore is ſaid to bee <hi>celeſtiall and diuine,</hi> that is, adorned with celeſtiall &amp; diuine powers &amp; gifts, which although they be a certain ſhadowe of the diuine nature, yet are they created qualities. Thirdly whereas <hi>the elect and ſaints are ſaid to bee of god, to bee borne of god and his ſpirite, and the ſonnes of god, and ſpirituall;</hi> Iohn. 1.13. &amp; 8.47. &amp; 3.6.

And this is ſaide to bee giuen or taken from God, not that God needeth it, or is profited thereby, but becauſe men ought, by order of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to perfourme and yeeld it vnto God.

For therefore is a thing thought right and honeſt, becauſe it is agreeing to the wil and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God: and becauſe God from euerlaſting is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his owne goodneſſe and vprightneſſe, and with

Wherefore the euerlaſting reioicing in God for our obedience and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the efficient cauſe of our obedience and ſaluation: but not contrariwiſe, our obedience the efficient cauſe of that reioicing in God: as it commeth to paſſe in men, who are affected by outwarde obiectes. <hi>Or thus:</hi> God reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at our good, as beeing an obiect, but not a cauſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe obiects are not the cauſe, but effects of gods appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and reioicing.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer when GOD pronounceth himſelfe to be <hi>vnchaungeable,</hi> hee ſheweth that hee will bee alwaies ſuch,<note place="margin">What is ment by Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes.</note> as hee hath beene from all eternity: ſo that firſt, <hi>neither his eſſence, and whatſoeuer is proper thereto, can bee augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diminiſhed: neither</hi> ſecondly, <hi>his nature and will bee chaunged: neither</hi> laſtly, <hi>himſelfe hath neede to tranſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from place to place.</hi> This doe Philoſophers, induced thereto by reaſons, confeſſe. For firſt, <hi>whatſoeuer is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that must needes haue, either ſome outwarde cauſe, or ſome originall or beginning in it ſelfe of moouing and chaunging, or both. But GOD cannot bee mooued or chaunged by anie thing which is without him:</hi> for ſo himſelfe ſhould not be the the firſt moouer and maker of all that is good in nature. <hi>Neither can he ſuffer chaunge from anie inwarde originall or beginning of chaunge.</hi> For whatſoeuer is ſo moued or changed, that muſt needs haue partes, whereof ſome muſt mooue &amp; ſome be moued. Now that god ſhould be diuided into parts, neither doth his immenſity ſuffer, nor his great perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ſeing euery part is imperfecter tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whol, &amp; in god is nothing which is not moſt perfect: it is impious to imagin any parts in him. <hi>Wherefore neither by any outwarde, nor inward cauſe is he moued or changed.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, <hi>whatſoeuer is changed, that muſt needs be changed either to the worſe, or to the better, or into a ſtate equal to the former. It is impoſſible that God ſhould bee made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer:</hi> for he ſhould ſo become of perfect vnperfect. <hi>And to be made better is alſo vnpoſſible.</hi> For ſo he ſhould haue bin before more vnperfect. <hi>But neither can he be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated into an equall

condition and ſtate,</hi> as thereby to leaue ſome good which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had, and to receiue ſome good which before hee had not: for thus ſhould he be neither before nor after his change moſt perfect, as wanting ſome part of thoſe good thinges which belonged vnto him. Thirdly, <hi>That which is infinite, neither can be made greater;</hi> for ſo it ſhoulde not haue beene infinite before; <hi>nor leſſer,</hi> for ſo it ſhoulde bee made finite. Seeing then both the eſſence, and power, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all the vertues of God are incomprehenſible, &amp; all things in God immenſe; therefore cannot any of them be either diminiſhed or increaſed. Fourthly.

may in ſome ſort conceiue ſomething of the nature of god and his wil towardes mankinde. Wherefore theſe formes of ſpeaking doe not ſignifie any perturbation in God, or change, or paſſion like vnto our affections, but are vſed to ſignifie theſe two things of God. Firſt, <hi>that that is not a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or diſſembled, but an earneſt, eternall, vnchangeable nature &amp; will in god,</hi> a ſhadow and image whereof he would haue the affections and motions created in men to be: yet is it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al trouble, or hinderance, or diminiſhing of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe and ioy.

The reaſons are, 1 <hi>God is the firſt cauſe of all thinges:</hi> Therefore he hath all thinges in his power, and their abilitie is ſo much, as he giueth vnto them. 2 <hi>Hee dooth ſuch thinges as can bee done by no created &amp; finit power:</hi> as are the creation &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all thinges, the preſeruation of common weales, the deluge, the deliuerie out of Aegypt, &amp; all his miracles. 3 <hi>He is vnchangeable.</hi> Therefore in him to be able to do, and to doe, is the ſame which to will, and ſo of the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But although al men affirme God to be omnipotent, <hi>yet there is a double difference betweene the ſacred Doctrine of the Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the doctrin of the church and philoſophie differ in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Gods omnipotencie.</note> 
                     <hi>and Philoſophie, concerning gods omnipotency.</hi> For firſt, <hi>without the doctrine of the Church, men only know the vniuerſall and generall power of god, whereby hee createth, preſerueth, and gouerneth the whole world: but they know not that power, whereby he ſaueth men, and reſtoreth the world by his ſonne, gathering and preſeruing an euerlaſting Church, and deliuering it from ſin and death, and endowing it with life and glory euerlaſting:</hi> by which works God eſpecially ſheweth forth his power, as it is ſaid, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Yet a litle while, &amp; I wil ſhake the heauens &amp; the earth, and the ſea, and the drie land.</hi> Secondly, <hi>neither doe they profeſſe of the generall power of god ſo much as is ſufficient.</hi> For albeit they are enforced to confeſſe that God is the author and preſeruer of the woorld: yet are they not able to ſaie that al things were created of nothing by the woorde of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: &amp; for as much as they are ignorant fo the cauſe of ſin &amp; confuſion, they cannot affirme al things ſo to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and gouerned by gods omnipotency, as that al which is good is done by the powerful working of Gods will: but they attribute many things to chance, fortune, &amp; humane wiſdome, or vertue, and ſo imagine the power of god to be idle in theſe and doing nothing.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, <hi>that god cannot either ſinne, or wil, and allowe of ſinne, or be changed, or diminiſhed, or ſuffer any thing, or make things doone vndoone, or wil thinges flat repugnant and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie, or create another god or ſome nature equal to himſelfe, or
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19538:169"/>
bee perceiued by bodilie ſenſes, or doe other thinges proper to a create or finite nature, or admit the ſame into himſelfe</hi> this doth not diminiſh or weaken, but rather augment &amp; ſtrengthen his power. For that is the greateſt and moſt perfect power, which can neither be deſtroied, nor weakned, nor dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: and that, none ſuſteining it, but only by it ſelfe. But contrariwiſe, to be able to be corrupted &amp; impaired, is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of imbecillity and imperfection <hi>of exceeding &amp; immenſe wiſedome.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods exceeding wiſedome: whereby both hee knoweth all thinges per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and is the fountaine of all knoweledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> That we may rightly and with profit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie know the power of God, it is neceſſarie not to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, but as it is ioyned with his immenſe wiſedome and goodneſſe, which moderateth it. Further, of his diuine wiſedome firſt we learne, <hi>That God doth of himſelfe in one act or view vnderſtand and behold perpetually and most perfectlie, in maruellous manner, and that vnknowen to vs, himſelfe and the whole order of his minde declared in the nature of thinges and in his woorde, and what agreeth therewith and diſagreeth, and all his woorkes, and the works of all creatures, paſt, preſent, and to come, &amp; all the cauſes and circumſtances of all things.</hi> And moreouer, <hi>That al Angels and men haue no more knowlege of diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane matters; than God doth woork &amp; maintaine in their minds.</hi> For among other thinges, the moſt beutiful and ſightlie order which is in the nature of thinges, the endes and vſes of all things, the ſignification of future euents, arts and ſciences, the euerting and ouerturning of thoſe deuiſes, which the Diuell and wicked men haue moſt craftily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued againſt God and all the godly, doe enforce all men to confeſſe, that theſe things could not proceed but from a moſt wiſe artificer and author. Wherefore alſo the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe willeth vs to conſider the wiſedome of God, ſhining in theſe his woorks. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 3.11. <hi>God hath made euerie thing beutiful in his time.</hi> Iſai. 44.7. <hi>Who is like me that ſhal cal, &amp; ſhal declare it, &amp; ſet it in order before me, ſince I appointed the ancient people?</hi> Ioh. 5.13. <hi>He taketh the wiſe in their craftineſſe.</hi> And of theſe hee concludeth, that the wiſedome of God is immenſe &amp; vnconceiueable. As, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145 7. <hi>His wiſdom is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit.</hi> Rom. 11.32. <hi>O the deepeneſſe of the riches both of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of God!</hi> But here again is to be obſerued a difference betweene Philoſophie and the word of God. Firſt, <hi>that euen in the creation, the knowen or legall wiſedome was
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:19538:170"/>
darkned and maimed in men through ſinne,</hi> and therefore nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a renewing by the woorde deliuered to the Church. And then, <hi>that men without this heauenlie doctrine are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of that eſpecial wiſedome of God reuealed in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, whereby he ſaueth the Church gathered from amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the ſon. As it is ſaid,</hi> Mat. 11. <hi>I giue thee thanks, O father, bicauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe &amp; men of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and haſt opened them vnto babes.</hi>

                     <hi>The goodneſſe of God ſignifieth</hi> ſometimes <hi>his bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> as Pſa. 106.1. <hi>Praiſe the Lord becauſe he is good:</hi> ſometimes <hi>all the vertues, and whatſoeuer is ſpoken of the nature of God.</hi> As Pſalm. 14. <hi>Let thy ſpirite leade mee thorough the right waie.</hi> That which alſo is meant by the name <hi>of holines or ſanctity and light.</hi> 1. Iohn 1. So in this place, firſt <hi>by the name of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are vnderſtoode al thoſe thinges which are attributed to god in his woorde, and are repreſented and reſembled in his image, as thoſe thinges which are termed good in Angels and men,</hi> as life, power, wiſedome, ioy, righteouſneſſe &amp;c. For ſuch is the nature of God, as it hath manifeſted it ſelfe in the Lawe and Goſpel, and the goodneſſe of the reaſonable creature, is an image of the diuine goodneſſe. And therefore here alſo differ philoſophy and the Scripture; in that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy attributeth onely to God that his goodneſſe which was opened in the Lawe, and yet neither that wholie: but of his goodneſſe reuealed in the Goſpell it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignoraunt. Secondly, <hi>by reaſon of the great and huge difference betweene the creatour, and the creature, we vnderſtand thoſe good thinges to bee in GOD, which are agreeing to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature and maieſtie.</hi> For thoſe which are proper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to created natures, woulde not bee good in GOD, but rather a diminiſhing of his goodneſſe. Thirdly, <hi>By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the immenſitie of his diuine nature, thoſe things which are finite in creatures are in GOD infinite.</hi> And therefore againſt ſundry and diuerſe diſputes of Philoſophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the chiefeſt good, we learne in the Church, <hi>that GOD is the chiefest good.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>becauſe nothing is vnperfect or not ſubſisting by it ſelfe in GOD: whatſoeuer is attributed vnto him, is not in him, as formes or accidentes in creatures: but ſuch is his eſſence and nature, in a manner not able to bee comprehended by our knoweledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:19538:170"/>
Fiftly, <hi>His nature and will is a rule of that goodneſſe and vprightneſſe which is in creatures.</hi> For ſo farre foorth thinges are, and are called good, as they agree with the wil of God. Sixtly, <hi>GOD is the onelie fountaine of goodneſſe, and the firſt cauſe of all good thinges:</hi> So that all thinges haue ſo much goodneſſe, as God dooth create and maintaine in them. And in this ſenſe is it ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>There is none good but God onelie,</hi> euen ſo, as hee is moſt perfectly good, and the fountaine of goodneſſe.</p>

                  <p>Secondly when men conſider, <hi>that God dooth not cauſe and bring to paſſe that no ſinne be committed, when yet he might moſt eaſily doe it: but farther that he puniſheth ſinnes which went before, with after-ſinnes; and paſſeth at his pleaſure thinges from one to another, as the Aegyptians goods to the Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 12. <hi>And yet theſe thinges to be forbidden vs by his Lawe: it ſeemeth vnto them, that God will, &amp; dooth ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his Lawe.</hi> But theſe thinges are contrarie to his Lawe and iuſtice, if they be done by men: but if God doe them, they are moſt iuſt, and are moſt agreeable to his Lawe. For creatures are bound one to another, one to prouide for anothers ſafety whenſoeuer hee can: But God is bound to none. Thirdly, ſome, <hi>when they heare that god dooth not giue alike and equallie to men, who all are
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:19538:172"/>
by nature equal, that is, the Sonnes of wrath, when as he conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and ſaueth ſome, hardeneth and condemneth others, they deeme that by this reaſon accepting of perſons is laide vpon God.</hi> But theſe men mark not, that then it is vniuſt to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equallie to thoſe who are equall, when a due and deſerued rewarde is paide, and that GOD doth giue his bleſſings vnto men not of due, but of his free bountifulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Reply. <hi>Thoſe thinges which are doone according to iuſtice, are doone as due. But that good ſhould be doone to thoſe who are good, the order of iuſtice requireth: Therefore good is doone vnto the good as due.</hi> Aunſwere. Al this is true, if wee talke of creatures. But if of God, not ſo: becauſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is bound to none, as the creatures are: neither can the creatures deſerue any thing of God, as they may one of another. Wherefore God puniſheth of iuſtice; but dooth good of grace and mercie; according as it is ſaide, <hi>When yee haue doone all, ſay, we are vnprofitable ſeruants, wee haue doone that which was our dutie to doe.</hi> And if any man reply, <hi>that not men onelie, but God alſo is bound by order of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to ſpare, and doe well to the good, out of thoſe wordes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> Gen. 8.23. <hi>Wilt thou alſo destroie the righteous with the wicked?</hi> It is to bee obſerued, that this bond is not of any deſert or right, that may make the Creatour to ſtand anſwerable to the Creature, but of gods promiſe and truth. For God did moſt freely and of his exceeding goodneſſe, when hee ought nothing to any, bind himſelfe by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes endented, to doe good vnto the godlie. And this goodneſſe of God and faithfulneſſe in keeping his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is often called iuſtice. And therefore it is well ſaide, that it agreeth not with God, to afflict anie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſeruedly, not becauſe hee ſhould iniurie any, though he deſtroied him not offending, but becauſe his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and bountifulneſſe and trueth doe not admit this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges are neceſſarily to be aſcribed of vs vnto the iuſtice of God, that the cogitation thereof may aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs of the puniſhment of the wicked, &amp; of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the Godly from their iniuries after this life: that ſo we may patiently beare, whatſoeuer he will lay vpon vs, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. it is ſaid, <hi>O Lord, righteouſnes belongeth vnto thee, but vnto vs open ſhame.</hi>

Wherefore alſo they know not the iuſtice of GOD puniſhing all ſinne with eternal pains in the wicked, or with that which is equiualent to eternall in his Sonne. They knowe not the Wiſedome, Mercie, Truth of god, freeing vs ſinners from death, and receiuing vs, without breach of his iuſtice, into fauour; Iuſtifiyng vs, ſanctifiyng, and glorifiyng vs in his Sonne by the holie ghoſt, according to his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Neither further doe they aſcribe vnto god fullie and wholy his Omnipotencie, Wiſedome, goodneſſe, which ſhineth in the creation of thinges, and in the continuall preſeruing of the ſame. For of manie things they haue either none, or but a darke knowledge: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things they ſubtract, and withdrawe from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and gouernement of god, and attribute it to their owne wiſedome, induſtrie, vertue, and ſtrengh, or aſcribe it to fortune, and chaunce. The like we are
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19538:176"/>
to conceiue of other attributes of god, in which they are alike blinde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Church acknowledgeth three perſons of one and the ſame Diuine Eſſence,</hi> that is, that the true god is an Eſſence, ſo in number one eternall and infinite, that notwithſtanding it is the ſame and whole ſubſtaunce of the three perſons: to wit, the eternall Father, and his Coëternall Sonne, and the Coëternall holy ghoſt: But the Heathen, and Pagans, and other ſectes doe not acknowledge three perſons, but as the Eſſence, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the perſon of the Godhead they profeſſe to bee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They which are not of the Church, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the works of the Churches ſaluation,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the reconciliation of men with god, iuſtification, ſanctification, and full deliuerie from all ſinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie by the Sonne and the holie ghoſt. <hi>Neither doe they wholy acknowlege or profeſſe the woorkes of Creation.</hi> For they doe not thinke all thinges to haue beene created of nothing, by the woorde of god onely: they denie all generally and each in particular, euen the leaſt, to bee adminiſtred power-fullie by the Omnipotencie of God: but aſcribe very manie to Chaunce, Fortune, and humane Wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, ſeeing out of the woorkes of god, as his proper affectes, are made knowen both the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or nature of the true god, as alſo the Trinitie of perſons in one godhead, and therefore god and eache of the perſons take their names from them; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe woorkes are both all and chieflie extant in the Church, and are by the Church rightly, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vnderſtoode: hereof is neceſſarily concluded, that hee alone who is made knowen in the woorde, and the Church, is the true and naturall god, and that hee is to bee knowen and diſcerned from Idols by the woorde onely, and by his benefites and reuelations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the Church; as the ſending of the holy ghoſt, the redemption of mankinde, regeneration, ſanctification and glorification; concerning the which Pagans and many other ſects know nothing at all.</p>

                     </gap>n themſelues abſolutely, and is common to them three, euen the verie eternal and one onely Deitie, or the verie being of God. By the name of <hi>Perſon</hi> is ſignified the manner, after which that beeing or Eſſence of God is in eache of theſe three, or the proper and ſeuerall manners of eache of their beeings. That is, Perſon, is that, which eache of theſe three are reſpectiuely or being compared one to the other: or, is that very being of god conſidered reſpectiuely to one and another, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct by a proper and peculiar manner of beeing and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting from the others. Wherefore <hi>in number there is one and the ſame Being or Eſſence in God,</hi> that is, in each of theſe three, who are god, <hi>but it is after a diuers manner in god.</hi> As when we ſpeake <hi>of god the father;</hi> that being is of it ſelfe, not from another. <hi>The ſonne</hi> is the father: <hi>The Sonne</hi> is the ſame being or Eſſence, but from the Father: <hi>The holie ghoſt</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is the ſelfe ſame diuine being, which the father is and the ſonne, but from the father and the ſonne. So <hi>the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, iuſtice, goodnes, bountifulnes, mercie, &amp;c. of theſe three are the verie diuine being or eſſence, which is in number one and the ſame in theſe three. But to be of himſelfe, or from another; likewiſe to be from one, or from two:</hi> (that is, to haue that one Eſſence of himſelfe, or to haue it communicated from an other, either from one or from two) <hi>is the manners of being which are three, to wit, The eternal father, and the ſonne, and the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19538:180"/>
ſpirite of them both.</hi> And this is it, that Iuſtine Martyr ſaith: <hi>There is one exiſtence or eſſence of the three, which is from none but of it ſelfe: becauſe it is but one: but the manners of the exiſtence are three.</hi> Wherefore as concerning exiſtence, Being, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence it ſelfe, the three perſons are of themſelues: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the maner of exiſting or beeing, the father is none but of himſelfe: The ſonne of the father; the holie Ghoſt, from both: The ſonne begotten, the holy Ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of the difference between the Eſſence and perſon is: <hi>the eſſence is abſolute and communicable; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſpectiue and incommunicable.</hi> This may bee made more manifeſt by exemplifiyng in a man. It is one thing, to bee a man, an other thing to bee a Father, or a Sonne; and yet one and the ſame, is both a man and a Father: but hee is a man abſolutely, or in himſelfe, or according to his owne nature; he is a father to another, or in reſpect of another, namely of his ſonne. Semblablie, it is one thing, to be God, another thing to be the father, or ſon, or holy ghoſt, and yet one and the ſame is both God, and father; god in reſpect of himſelfe, or his own nature; father in reſpect of the ſonne. Again, <hi>the eſſence of a man who beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth another is communicated to him who is begot: but the perſon, or indiuidual, is not communicated.</hi> For the begetter bringeth forth not himſelfe, but another diſtinct from himſelfe, the ſame eſſence notwithſtanding being communicated vnto him. And no relatiue is his correlatiue, or any part thereof. Therefore the ſonne is not the father, nor the father the ſonne, although both bee true man. So in like ſort, the eternall Father hath by eternall generating communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Sonne his Eſſence, but not his Perſon, that is, hee begot not the Father, but the Sonne, neither is the Father the Sonne, or the Sonne the Father; albeit each is true God.<note place="margin">God, and man communicate both their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but their maner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating is moſt different, and is much to be obſerued.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although this be like in God and man, that both doe communicate to an other not his Perſon, but his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: yet <hi>is there an exceeding diſſimilitude in the maner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the diuine Eſſence being infinite, and the humane being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and finite is communicated to another:</hi> Which diſſimilitude is diligently to be obſerued. For firſt, <hi>in men, in the father &amp;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:19538:180"/>
the Sonne, the Eſſence is as diſtinct as the Perſons themſelues.</hi> The father and the Sonne are not onely two perſons, but alſo two men diſtinct in eſſences: So that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not that man, which is the ſonne. <hi>But in God the perſons are ſo diſtinct, that yet the eſſence remaineth common, one and the ſame,</hi> and therefore there are not three Gods, but the Sonne is the ſame God in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is the Father and the Sonne. Secondlie, <hi>In perſons created, hee that begetteth and generateth doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his whole eſſence to him that is begotten: (For then hee ſhould ceaſe to be a man,) but only a part, which being alotted and ſeuered out of the eſſence of him that begetteth, is conueied or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued into him that is begotten, and is made the eſſence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indiuiduall or perſon, diſtinct from the eſſence of the indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall who begetteth. But in vncreated perſons he that begetteth or inſpireth, communicateth his whole eſſence to him that is begotten or proceedeth, or is inſpired: yet ſo, that he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth doth reteine the ſame, and that whole.</hi> The reaſon of both differences is, <hi>that the eſſence of man, as alſo of other creatures, is finite and diuiſible, the eſſence of God infinite and indiuiſible: and therefore the Deity may, beeing the ſame and whole or entire, bee together both communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and reteined.</hi> Wherefore the eternall Father, and Sonne, and holy Ghoſt are that one true GOD: and yet the Father is not the Sonne, or the holy Ghoſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the holy Ghoſt the Sonne; that is, they are one God, not three Gods, but three perſons, ſubſiſting in one God.</p>
                  <p>By the name <hi>of Trinity,</hi> are vnderſtoode the three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of beeing in God, that is, three not eſſences, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame diuine Eſſence. <hi>Now Trinity and triplicitie,</hi> as alſo <hi>Trinal and triple differ.</hi> That is ſaid to be <hi>Triple,</hi> which is compounded of three eſſences, or is diſtinct by three eſſences. <hi>Trinall</hi> is that, which in eſſence is but one and moſt ſimple, but hath three manners of beeing. <hi>God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not Triple;</hi> becauſe there are not mo eſſences: <hi>but Trinall,</hi> becauſe he beeing one according to his eſſence, is three according to his perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This difference of eſſence and perſon is to be obſerued and held.</hi> 1 <hi>Least the vnitie of the true God be diſtracted.</hi> 2 <hi>Leaſt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:19538:181"/>
the distinction of the perſons be taken awaie.</hi> 3. <hi>Leaſt another thing be vnderſtoode by the name of perſon, than the truth of gods woorde declareth.</hi> For <hi>perſon</hi> in this place doth not ſignifie only a relation or office, as the Latines are wont to ſpeak, <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis perſonam tueri, to defend the perſon of the Prince,</hi> as of olde, <hi>Sabellius</hi> falſely taught: muchleſſe doth it ſignifie the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or viſible ſhape (as in theſe daies <hi>Seruetus</hi> ſported and trifled with the word, <hi>perſon</hi>) repreſenting the forme, or geſture of another; ſuch as is the perſon of a ſtage plaier: but it ſignifieth <hi>a thing ſubſistent,</hi> truely diſtinct fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, vnto whom it hath a relation &amp; reſpect, by an incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable property: that is, it ſignifieth that which begetteth, or which is begotten, or which proceedeth; not the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or dignity, or degree of him that begetteth, or is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or proceedeth. Furthermore, <hi>the perſons are not anie thing ſeparated from the eſſence, but each of them are the verie ſelfeſame whole eſſence of the Diuinitie.</hi> But the difference is in this, that the perſons are each diſtinct from the other, but the eſſence is common to them three. And, that the perſon is no other thing ſubſiſting, or other ſubſtaunce, than the eſſence, may be vnderſtoode in ſome ſort, by the example of a man. One and the ſame man, or one and the ſame ſubſtaunce, is a father and a man, or a ſonne and a man: and yet the manhoode, or, to be a man, is one thing; the fatherhoode, or, to bee a father, another: but there is not one ſubſiſtent which is the father, and another ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent which is a man, but one and the ſame ſubſiſtent is both, becauſe both manhoode and fatherhoode is in him: manhood abſolutely, fatherhood reſpectiuely as in regard of his Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Of the worde <hi>eſſence</hi> alſo it is furder to be noted, that <hi>God or the Deitie or diuine eſſence is not in reſpect of the perſons, the ſame which the matter in reſpect of the effect:</hi> becauſe God is vnchaungeable, neither is compounded of matter and forme. Therefore we cannot ſay wel: Three perſons are, or, conſiſt of one eſſence: <hi>Neither is it as the whole in reſpect of the parts:</hi> becauſe God is indiuiſible. Wherefore it is not well ſaide, that the perſon is a part of the eſſence, or the eſſence conſiſteth of three perſons: for euery perſon is the whole diuine eſſence, one and the ſame. <hi>Neither is it as the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:19538:181"/>
general to the ſpeciall,</hi> becauſe the perſons are not ſpecials, but indiuiduals. <hi>Neither is it ſimplie as the ſpecial to the indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,</hi> becauſe the diuine eſſence it ſelfe is indiuiduall, or one in number: and the perſons are not another, or a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, or a ſeparated thing from the eſſence, but euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that eſſence. Therefore it is well ſaid, <hi>God or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eſſence, is the father, is the ſonne is the holy ghoſt:</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>The three perſons are one God, or in one God:</hi> Againe, <hi>they are one and the ſame eſſence, nature, diuinity, wiſedome, &amp;c. They are of one or the ſame eſſence, nature, diuinitie, &amp;c.</hi> Yet it cannot bee ſaide well, they are of one God. Wherefore <hi>the diuine eſſence is in reſpect of the perſons, as a thing after a rare and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular maner communicated, in reſpect of thoſe things, vnto which it is common.</hi> For neither is there the like example of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in any created things. <hi>For a generall is a certain thing common to manie ſpecials, &amp; a general and ſpecial to manie indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduals: but yet ſo, that they are affirmed of thoſe manie plurallie, not ſingularlie: as, that the father, and the ſonne, or this father and ſonne are two liuing creatures, two men. But wee maie not ſpeake after this ſort of God and the diuine perſons, as to ſaie, the father and the ſonne are two Gods, two ſpirites, two omnipotentes, &amp;c. Becauſe there is but one GOD, one ſpirite, one omnipotent, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore that affirmation, the father is God, the Son is God, the holy Ghoſt is God, is a true affirmation affirming that which is more common of a thing which is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict: that is, affirming the eſſence of the indiuidual; which hath in ſome ſort an analogy and proportion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſpeciall affirmed of his indiuiduall, but is not at al the ſame, nor of the ſame kind.</p>

                  <p>The third cauſe is, <hi>that the ſleights and ſophiſmes of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, which for the moſt part they goe about to cloake and couer with the woords of holie Scripture, are more eaſily eſpied and taken heede of, if the ſame things bee expounded in diuerſe woordes, and thoſe eſpeciallie ſhort, perſpicuous, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant.</hi> So the ſectaries and followers of Seruetus do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the Father, the Sonne, and the holy ghoſt, are one God, but not one in eſſence, but by propagation, that is, that they are not <gap reason="foreign">

Secondly, <hi>The ſame is proued by thoſe places of Scripture, which giue vnto theſe three, the Father, the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt, the name of Iehoua and true God.</hi> In like manner thoſe places wherein thoſe thinges which are ſpoken of Iehoua in the old Teſtament, are in the newe referred expreſſely and moſt plainly to the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt. Thirdlie, <hi>thoſe places which attribute the ſame whole diuine eſſence to the three;</hi> and ſhew that the Sonne is the proper Sonne of the father, moſt truly begotten of him: and that the holy ghoſt is the ſpirit of the father and the Sonne, and that ſo proper and peculiar as that he is, and proceedeth of God, which is the father and the ſonne. The ſonne therefore and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt haue the ſame, and that whole eſſence of the Deity, which the Father hath: The Sonne hath it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated of the father by beeing borne of him, and the holy Ghoſt of the father and the ſonne, by proceeding from them. Fourthly, <hi>thoſe places, which giue vnto the three the ſame attributes or properties and perfections of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> namely, eternity, immenſity, omnipotency, &amp;c.

Sixtlie, <hi>thoſe places, which yeeld to the three equall honour and worſhippe, and ſuch as agreeth to the true god alone.</hi> By this conſent therefore of the olde and newe Teſtament it is confirmed, that one GOD is three

                     <hi>8</hi> How the three perſons of the godhead are diſtinguiſhed.</head>
                  <p>THeſe perſons are diſtinguiſhed two waies:<note place="margin">The three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by their inwarde workes mutuallie dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towardes one another.</note> 
                     <hi>by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward woorkes: and by their outward woorkes. Their inwarde works are thoſe which the perſons haue and exerciſe one towardes another.</hi> By theſe then they are diſtinguiſhed, in <hi>that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is and exiſteth of himſelfe, not from another.</hi> Hee begot the Sonne, &amp; inſpired the holy Ghoſt, by communicating his eſſence vnto them after an vnſpeakable manner. <hi>The ſonne hath his beeing from the father, beggotten of him from euerlaſting,</hi> that is, he hath the ſame eſſence with the father, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto him from the father. <hi>The holie ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from euerlaſting from the father and the Sonne,</hi> that is, hath the ſame eſſence, but communicated vnto him from the father and the Sonne. Obiection. <hi>That which is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode cannot be diſcerned or diſtinguiſhed: the manner of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and generating of the Sonne, and of the proceeding of the holie ghoſt is not vnderſtoode. Therefore they cannot bee diſcerned or diſtinguiſhed.</hi> Aunſwere. Thoſe things cannot be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which are not at all vnderſtoode, neither in reſpect of the proper cauſes thereof, nor in reſpect of the effects. But that the ſon is begotten of the father, and the holy ghoſt proceedeth from the father and the ſonne, we know out of the holy Scriptures. We vnderſtand alſo in ſome ſort, what this is, <hi>namely, the ſonne to be begotten of the father: For to bee borne or to be begotten, is to be produced out of his eſſence who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth to haue his eſſence communicated vnto him of him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth.</hi> Albeit the maner, whereby the eternal father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his eſſence, the ſame whole and entire vnto his
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:19538:184"/>
ſon, we conceiue not. The like alſo is to be vnderſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the proceeding of the holy ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Here is to be obſerued alſo, that it is truly ſaid, <hi>The ſon is begotten: The holie ghoſt proceedeth.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>The diuine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is produced, begotten, proceedeth of the eſſence of the father, or of the father and the ſon.</hi> But not truly: <hi>The diuine eſſence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, or begotten, or proceedeth.</hi> Yet truly it is ſaid, <hi>The diuine eſſence is giuen, communicated to another, receiued of another.</hi> The reaſon hereof is, for that <hi>to bee giuen, communicated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The perſon, not the eſſence, of the Sonne is begotten.</note> ſtretcheth further than <hi>to bee produced, begotten, or to proceede.</hi> For not whatſoeuer is giuen, communicated, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is alſo begotten. Further, that is ſaid <hi>to bee begotten, not which is communicated to the thing begotten, but that, vnto which the ſubſtaunce of him that begetteth is communicated:</hi> So the eſſence of GOD the father, is not begotten, or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from another, and yet the ſelfe ſame eſſence of it ſelfe ſubſiſting, is giuen and communicated to the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt, and receiued of the Sonne and the holy GHOST. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.26. <hi>The father likewiſe hath giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe.</hi> Neither dooth it followe: <hi>The perſon is begotten: therefore the Eſſence is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi> For that which is affirmed truely of a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue, is not neceſſarily to bee affirmed of a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in his owne nature. For although euerie father hath a Sonne: yet not euerie thing, of which it maie bee truely affirmed, that it is a father, maie bee ſaid to haue a Sonne. Albeit then the perſon of the Sonne is begotten: yet whatſoeuer is the Sonne is not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their outward works extended vnto the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures.</note>Another difference of the perſons is, <hi>in the order of their outwarde actions,</hi> which they exerciſe towardes the creatures, in them, and by them. <hi>The Father woorcketh, createth, ſanctifieth of himſelfe, by the Sonne and the holie Ghost.</hi> Hee ſendeth them, and is not ſent. <hi>The Sonne woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the Father by the holie Ghost:</hi> hee is ſent of the Father: hee ſendeth the holy Ghoſt: <hi>The holie Ghoſt woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and is ſent from both.</hi> His working is ſaid to bee from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who woorketh anothers will and pleaſure going before, his owne accompanieng and following it, not in time, but in the order of woorking. <hi>The perſons therefore differ
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19538:184"/>
not in the woorkes themſelues, but in the manner onelie and order of working.</hi> The work is not diſtinct: the manner of working is diſtinct. <hi>The father is called the firſt perſon,</hi> becauſe the Deity is communicated vnto him from none. <hi>The Sonne, the ſecond perſon:</hi> becauſe the Deity is communicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the Father. <hi>The holie Ghoſt, the third:</hi> becauſe the eſſence of the father and the ſon is communicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the father and the ſon. Now <hi>the firſt and laſt</hi> are here ſaid, not as in degree, or dignity, or time, but onely in order of exiſting and working.</p>
                  <p>This eight queſtion together with the former ſhall be more at large explicated in the Articles of the ſonne and the holy Ghoſt.</p>

Therefore we muſt firſt know the ſonne, and then for the ſon we muſt know the father, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him. Likewiſe no man is ſanctified and ſaued by the holy Ghoſt who knoweth not the holy Ghoſt. For he who receiueth not the holy Ghoſt is not ſaued. But no man receiueth him, whom hee knoweth not. Therefore who knoweth him not is not ſaued.

The maior is true of the mutation &amp; entercourſe of things now begunne after the creation, but not of the firſt orignal of theſe mutations, &amp; changes, which we now ſee in the world.

For if God dooth not reſpect and rule humane affaires, then neither were good things to be deſired of him, neither were hee to be praiſed for them receiued, who doth not giue them: neither his anger to be feared, who doth not puniſh: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were we to liue according to his will, who requireth not obedience, nor maketh or keepeth anie difference betweene the good, and bad.

Yea and all the haires of your head are numbered:</hi> Like to theſe are found infinite teſtimonies in the Scripture, not onely as concerning the generall rule, but alſo as concerning particular examples. For there is almoſt no point of heauenly Doctrine, which is more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently inculcated &amp; vrged in the old Teſtament, than the Doctrine <hi>of Gods prouidence.</hi> So in <hi>Ier.</hi> 27. God reaſoneth from the generall to the particular, that is, from the rule it ſelfe to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.

And both theſe proofes, and reaſons are demonſtratiue, neceſſarily and irrefragably proouing that which is in queſtion, and common to Philoſophy with Diuinity.

For <hi>as god brought the wind vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth,</hi> Gen. 8. <hi>ſo doth he bring the wind out of his treaſures,</hi> Pſal. 135. <hi>As he would that he,</hi> of whom it is ſpoken, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. <hi>ſhould bee borne blinde, ſo doth he make the deafe and the dumbe, him that ſeeth, and the blind.</hi> Exod 4.

For therefore doth the ſcripture, to teache vs how to collect and gather, recount ſo many examples of Gods prouidence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>there are alſo places of Scripture, wherein the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall referring of all thinges to the prouidence of God is plainlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, or is ſignified by a Synecdoche (which figure of ſpeeche wee vſe when we ſignifie the whole by a part, or a part by the whole) or by the comparing of leſſer things with greater, or greater with leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</hi> Ezec. 12.25. <hi>The thing that I ſhal ſpeake ſhall come to paſſe.</hi> And God ſpeaketh, not onely thoſe things which he reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto vs, but whatſoeuer alſo from euerlaſting hee hath decreed and purpoſed with himſelfe.</p>

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:19538:210"/>
but not by the prouidence of God,</hi> that is, God willing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding, and woorking them. For all good thinges are done, God willing them: euill, God permitting them. And <hi>God wil thoſe things,</hi> by his wil, which he liketh, worketh and commandeth. <hi>He permitteth thoſe thinges</hi> which he neither liketh, nor commandeth, nor worketh nor furthereth: but which he condemneth, forbiddeth, &amp; puniſheth. That ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth eſpecially out of thoſe teſtimonies, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged concerning reaſonable creatures: For they ſhewe that all reaſonable creatures, both Angels, and men, and thoſe both good, and bad, are ruled and gouerned by Gods prouidence: but ſo, that whatſoeuer good is in them, that is from god himſelfe, who worketh this in reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but whatſoeuer ill is in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is of themſelues, being by nature euil, not of God who is moſt good.

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:19538:219"/>
neither the firſt cauſe can woorke otherwiſe, than doe the ſecond, and therefore all effectes of all cauſes are abſolutelie neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> This opinion of the Stoickes, becauſe it ſpoileth God of his libertie and omnipotency, and aboliſheth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and manner of woorking in ſecond cauſes diſpoſed by Gods diuine wiſedome, not onely founder Philoſophy, but the Church alſo reiecteth and contemneth, and doth openly profeſſe her diſſenting from the Stoickes.

Secondly, <hi>the Stoikes were of opinion, that neither God nor ſecond cauſes can doe any thing of their owne nature otherwiſe than they do.</hi> The church affirmeth, that not only ſecond cauſes are made &amp; ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by god, ſome to bring forth certaine &amp; definit effects, ſome variable and contrary; but God himſelfe alſo coulde from euerlaſting either not haue decreed, or haue decreed &amp; wrought otherwiſe, either by ſecond cauſes, or without them, and by them either changeable in their own nature, or vnchangeable, al things whoſe contrary are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his nature: &amp; that hee hath ſo decreed them, and doth ſo work them, not bicauſe he could not otherwiſe, but becauſe it ſo pleaſed him, as it is ſaid <hi>Pſ.</hi> 115.3. <hi>Our god is in heauen, he doth whatſoeuer he wil.</hi> And Luk. 1.37. <hi>With god ſhal nothing be impoſſible:</hi> that is, which is not againſt his nature, or whereby his nature is not ouerthrowen, as it is ſaide 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>

Wherefore it followeth that all things come to paſſe, not by ſimple &amp; abſolute neceſſity, but by that of ſuppoſition or conſequence. <hi>And neceſſitie of conſequence doth not at al take away contingency.</hi> The reaſon hereof is this: <hi>Becauſe the ſame effect may haue cauſes whereof ſome may produce it by an order changeable, ſome by vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order, &amp; therefore in reſpect of ſome it is contingent, &amp; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome, neceſſary.</hi> For as the originals or cauſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency in things are that liberty which is in the will of god, and Angels, and men, and the mutable nature of the matter of the elementes, together with the readineſſe or inclination thereof to diuers motions and formes: ſo the cauſe <hi>of abſolute neceſſitie in God</hi> is the very vnchangeable nature of god; but the cauſe <hi>of that neceſſitie which is onely by conſequent,</hi> is the diuine prouidence or decree comming between thoſe things which are in their own nature mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, &amp; alſo the nature of things created, which is framed and ordained of god to certaine effects, and yet ſubiect to the moſt free wil &amp; gouernment of god, either according, or beſides, or contrary to this order which himſelfe hath made. <hi>In reſpect therefore of ſecond cauſes, ſome things are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> which are done by cauſes woorking alwaies after one ſort, as the motion of the ſon, the burning of any matter put vnto the fier, if it be capeable of burning: <hi>ſome thinges are contingent,</hi> which haue cauſes working contingently,

that is, apt and fit to produce or to forbeare producing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe &amp; contrary effects: as the blaſts of windes, the locall motions of liuing creatures, the actions of mens wils. <hi>But in reſpect of the firſt cauſe:</hi> that is, <hi>of the wil of god, all thinges which are, or are doone in Gods externall and outward woorks, are partly neceſſary, partly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingent: neceſſary,</hi> as eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe things which haue ſecond cauſes moſt chaungeable: as that the bones of Chriſt on the croſſe were not broken by the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by reaſon of the vnchangeablenes of the decree &amp; prouidence of God: <hi>contingent,</hi> (by reaſon of the liberty of his eternal and vnchangeable decree, and the execution thereof) euen thoſe thinges which, as concerning their owne nature, haue ſecond cauſes moſt vnchangeable, as the motion of the ſunne &amp; ſhadowes.</p>

His office</hi> is ſummarily expounded in the ſame two articles: but particularly in thoſe which folow, euen vnto the third part of the Creed, wherein is entreated concerning the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are two parts of his office: humiliation, or merite: and glorification, or efficacie. Of his humiliation,</hi> whereby Chriſt hath promerited and deſerued for vs his benefices, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, remiſſion of ſinnes, and reconciliation and attonement with God, the holy Ghoſt, and life euerlaſting, theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſpeake; <hi>Hee ſuffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, buried, deſcended into hell.

the quicke and the dead.</hi> Hence it appeareth with how great wiſedome the articles were written, and applied to the queſtion of the Mediatour, For as it deſcendeth in order from the firſt to the laſt ſtep and degree of Chriſts humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is ſignified by his deſcention into hell, and is the feeling of the horrible iudgement, and wrath of God againſt the ſinnes of mankinde: ſo it aſcendeth from the leſſer glorie, which beganne from his reſurrection, to the higheſt and greateſt, which is betokened by his ſitting at the right hand of GOD the Father. The ſame order and the ſame wiſedome is ſeene in the firſt part of the Creede. It is alſo apparent in the third part, which is as it were the fruit of the articles going before, wherein are recited in moſt notable order the benefites which Chriſt promeriting by his paſſion, applieth to vs by his ſpirite. <hi>For the benefites of Chriſt are different from his office. His benefites</hi> are the thinges themſelues, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs and beſtoweth on vs, to wit, remiſſion of ſinnes, or our reconciliation with God, the giuing of his holy ſpirit, and life euerlaſting. <hi>His office is,</hi> to promerit in thoſe things for vs by his obedience, and to beſtowe them on vs by his owne power and efficacie.</p>

                     <hi>ANnointing in the old teſtament was a ceremonie, whereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to gods ordinance Prophets, Prieſts, and Kings were annointed either with ſome ſpeciall, or with common oile: that it might ſtand for a teſtimonie, to thoſe who were rightlie annointed, that they were called of god to the adminiſtring of one of theſe functions, and that they ſhould be furniſhed from god with giftes neceſſarie for the performing of that whereunto they were called.</hi>

For Annointing ſignified, 1. <hi>The calling and ordaining of anie to the office eyther of a Prophet, or of a Prieſt, or of a King.</hi> 2. <hi>It ſignified the promiſe and beſtowing of giftes neceſſarie thereto.</hi> For to whome GOD committed anie office, and whome hee cauſed to bee annointed, to theſe alſo hee ſubminiſtered the giftes of the holie GHOST neceſſarie for the diſcharging of it, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wiſedome, ſtrength, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Further, the outwarde annointing did as a ſigne repreſent the inwarde, that is, the giftes of the holy GHOST, as the thinges ſignified, by reaſon of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent Analogie and proportion. For as oile maketh the drie partes, beeing annointed therewith, liuely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, and able and fitte to doe their duetie, and beſides to ſend foorth a ſweete fauour: So the holie Ghoſt furniſhing them with neceſſarie giftes, which are ordained to a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, giueth them ſtrength and power, whereby they being of themſelues vnfit to doe any good, are made fit and able to woorke and accompliſh thinges gratefull vnto God: that is, the holie Ghoſt cauſeth them to diſpatch readilie and with dexteritie the partes of that dutie which is enioined them, and to doe thinges acceptable to GOD, and auaileable for the preſeruation of the Church.</p>

                  <p>Hence wee learne and vnderſtand theſe two thinges. The firſt is, <hi>That Christ hath this name, not from the ceremonial annointing, but from the thing it ſelfe which was thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi>
                     <pb n="442" facs="tcp:19538:230"/>
becauſe he is that chiefe and high Prophet,<note place="margin">Chriſt hath his name, not from the ceremonial annointing, but from the thing thereby ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Prieſt and King, whom, as types, the Prophetes, Prieſtes, and Kinges of the olde Teſtament, which were wont to bee annointed with external oile, did repreſent. The name therefore of the ſigne or type, that is, Annointed, is transferred to the thing it ſelf, euen to the High-Prieſt, Prophet &amp; King, Ieſus. Another thing that wee learne is,<note place="margin">The difference between Chriſt Annointed, and the Annointed of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                     <hi>That there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between this Ieſus Annointed, and the Annointed of the olde teſtament.</hi> For 1. <hi>There were only certaine types and ſhadowes of this onely chief and true Chriſt,</hi> that is, of this King, Prophet, &amp; Prieſt. <hi>Wherefore neceſſary was it that they ſhould yeeld &amp; giue place to him being once exhibited.</hi> For the thing it ſelfe being come &amp; exhibited, the types ceaſe. 2. <hi>The annointing, that is, the communicating of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt in the typicall Annointed was imperfect &amp; weake. But in Ieſus chriſt it is perfect &amp; exceeding great. For in him dwelleth the fulnes of the Godhead perſonally,</hi> ſo that he is both the Annointed &amp; the Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 3. <hi>He onlie hath receiued all the giftes of the holie Ghoſt, and thoſe manie waies more excellent than they are to bee found in all the Angels and men:</hi> Becauſe hee had them in the higheſt both number and degree. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe haue all wee receiued. But the Annointed of the old teſtament receiued neither all the giftes, neither in the higheſt degree, but diuided, and according to the meaſure of the gift of chriſt, ſome more, ſome fewer, &amp; ſome greater gifts than ſome,</hi> 1. Cor. 12.11. Ep. 4.7. <hi>Much leſſe were they able by their own power and vertue to worke the ſame in others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Replie 1. <hi>GOD cannot bee annointed: chriſt is GOD. Therefore he coulde not be annointed, no not with the prefigured or ſignified oile.</hi> Aunſwere. In ſome reſpect wee graunt this whole reaſon. For Chriſt as touching his God-head, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be annointed with the giftes of the holie GHOST. Firſt, <hi>becauſe not one iot of the giftes of the holie Ghoſt can bee added to the God-head, becauſe of the exceeding perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> And further, <hi>becauſe the holie Ghoſt, by whome the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is immediately adminiſtred, is the proper ſpirite of chriſt, no leſſe proceeding from him, than from the father.</hi> Wherefore he, as he is God, hath not any thing from the holy Ghoſt, neither dooth hee receiue him, which is alreadie his owne from any other, but giueth him vnto others whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:19538:230"/>
him: As alſo no man can giue thee thy ſpirite which is in thee, becauſe that which thou already haſt cannot bee giuen vnto thee.</p>
                  <p>Reply 2. <hi>According to which nature chriſt is annointed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame he is Mediator, that is, the Prophet, Prieſt, and King of the church. But according to his humane nature only he is annointed: Therefore according to that only he is Mediatour.</hi> The Minor is thus proued. <hi>To be annointed, is, to receiue the gifts of the holie Ghoſt: But according to his humane nature onlie hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued theſe giftes:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In what ſenſe Chriſt may bee ſaide to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore according to that onelie he is annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior of the former reaſon is made of a bad and faultie definition: becauſe the definition is of too ſtrait and narrowe a compaſſe. For to bee annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is not onely to receiue the giftes: but alſo to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſome certaine office. In the former ſenſe Chriſt is annointed according to his humanitie only: in the later, according to both natures. Or, we may aunſwere that the whole reaſon is faulty, becauſe of an ambiguity in the word <hi>annointing.</hi> For in the Maior, it is taken either for the whole annointing, or for that part, which is an ordeining to an office: but in the Minor it is taken for the other part onely, which is the participation of the giftes of the holie Ghoſt. Nowe then, <hi>according to which nature chriſt is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi> that is, neither ſeuerally by a deſignement to an office: neither by both a deſignement to an office &amp; a receiuing of the giftes of the holie Ghoſt: <hi>according to that nature he is not Mediatour. Chriſt according to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade is not annointed,</hi> both with a deſignement to an office, and a receiuing of giftes: yet is hee according to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade annointed by an ordaining or deſignement to an office. <hi>Therefore hee is Mediatour alſo according to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt therefore is Mediatour, that is, the Prophet, Priest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour according to both natures.</note> 
                     <hi>and King of the church in reſpect of both natures.</hi> For vnto the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediatour doe mo actions concur, whereof ſome he executeth by his Godhead, ſome by his fleſh; yet ſo, that they are don &amp; performed together, the properties of both natures being as it were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated. Wherefore that we er not here, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue amiſſe, theſe two rules ar to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. The firſt: <hi>the properties of the one nature in the mediator,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:19538:231"/>
are attributed to the other in the concrete, that is, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet ſtill in reſpect of that nature whoſe properties they are. This is called the communicating of the properties,</hi> &amp; it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of Synecdoche. The ſecond. <hi>The names of the mediatorſhip are attributed to the whole perſon, in reſpect of both natures, yet reſeruing ſtill the properties of each nature, and the differences of actions.</hi> For to the perfourming of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourſhip, the properties of faculties and operations both of the diuine and of the humane nature are required.</p>

                     <hi>According to his humanitie hee is not the naturall and proper ſonne of god;</hi> becauſe his humanitie as touching it ſelfe, is not the perſon, and it iſſued from the ſubſtance of his mother, not from the ſubſtaunce of GOD: <hi>But he is the ſonne of god by grace, not of adoption,</hi> becauſe he was at no time not his ſonne, as that hee ſhoulde bee made of no ſonne, or of the ſonne of wrath, the ſonne of God; <hi>but by grace of conception by the holie ghoſt, and of vnion with the word.</hi> For his humanitie was from the very wombe ſanctified, and vnited to the Godhead of the <hi>Word,</hi> which Godhead is the ſonne by nature.<note place="margin">That Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his fleſh was a ſonne by grace, not by merit of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</note> And that a maſſe of fleſhe in ſo maruelous manner, by the power of the holy Ghoſt, ſhoulde bee ſeuered out of the fleſhe of the Virgin, and that thereof beeing ſanctified ſhoulde bee formed a true humane bodie, that is, quickened with a humane ſoule, &amp; the ſame to be vnited to the verie ſonne of god in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one perſon &amp; ſubſiſtence, was not the merite of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as which had not as yet any being, &amp; is in it ſelfe but a creature; but the ſpeciall &amp; free gift or benefite of God, as Paul in plaine woordes declareth, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>It pleaſed (ſaith hee) the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> And Phil. 2.9. <hi>God hath giuen him a name aboue euerie name.</hi> Chriſt therefore as touching his humane nature was as the Sonne of GOD by grace, euen preſently from that very moment when hee beganne to bee borne man, and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:19538:241"/>
that therefore, becauſe by the vertue of the holy Ghoſt he was borne, of the ſubſtance of the Virgin, pure from al ſtain or corruption, and ſo was perſonally vnited with the <hi>Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obiection. <hi>Euerie ſonne is either natural, or adopted: Chriſt according to his humanitie is not the naturall ſonne of god: hee is therefore the ſonne of god by adoption.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior of this reaſon, albeit it may be graunted according to ciuil conſtitutions, yet is it falſe in diuinitie; becauſe it compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not a perfect and ſufficient enumeration of the ſonnes of God. For there are ſonnes of God by grace, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Iob. 1.6. likewiſe Chriſt, according to his humanity, which yet are not adopted ſonnes.

The Maior of this reaſon either is particular, and ſo nothing is inferred thereby: or if it be generallie taken, it is a fallacie. For grace is more large in ſignification then is adoption, and is in reſpect of adoption, as a generall in reſpect of a ſpeciall. For beſides the grace of adoption, there is alſo the grace of creation, in reſpect of God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and conforming Angels and men vnto himſelfe: the grace of conception and vnion, in reſpect of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſonne and the holy Ghoſt, forming and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after a ſingular maner the fleſh of CHRIST in the wombe of the Virgine, and vniting it vnto the ſonne.</p>

But the fleſhe or humanity of CHRST is not before all thinges, is not creatreſſe, but created in the laſt times, doth not vpholde or ſuſtaine all thinges with his woord, beck, and effectuall will, but is it ſelfe ſuſtained and vpheld by the <hi>Woorde,</hi> who
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:19538:248"/>
did aſſume and take it. Therefore in Chriſt beſides his fleſh is another nature, which alſo, before the fleſh was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſlie conceiued in the Virgins wombe, was ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, did woorke, and is the Sonne of God. Againe, <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne it:</hi> The Father ſent the Sonne into the woorlde, but the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Sonne was borne in the woorlde: Therefore he was his Sonne before he was ſent into the woorlde, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The ſonne quickneth whom he wil.</hi> Matth. 11.27. <hi>No man knoweth the Father, but the Sonne, and hee to whome the Sonne wil reueile him.</hi> But in the old Teſtament, before Ieſus was borne of the Virgine, ſome were raiſed from the dead, and quickened: for there were ſome from the beginning of the woorlde who knewe GOD aright. Therefore in Ieſus the Sonne of Marie, is another nature beſides his fleſhe, which is the Sonne of GOD, and ſubſiſted from the beginning of the woorlde reueiling GOD vnto men; not onely to thoſe of the godly who liued ſince hee tooke fleſhe, but to thoſe alſo who liued before it. Againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13.17.19.31. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.28. &amp;c. <hi>Hee is called the ſonne, who came from heauen, who beeing in earth is in heauen, who came into the woorlde,</hi> not as other men, from the earth, but from aboue out of heauen, from the Father. So that then hee was, before he came into the woorlde. But the fleſhe of CHRIST is not of heauen, neither came it from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Therefore there muſt needes bee another nature in him, in reſpect whereof hee is the onely begotten Sonne of GOD, euen before he tooke fleſhe of the Virgine. Againe, <hi>He that was manifested in the fleſh, is GOD,</hi> 1. Timot. 3. and therefore another nature from the fleſh. For God is one thing, who is manifeſted, and the fleſh another thing, wherein hee is manifeſted. The Sonne of God is hee that was manifeſted in the fleſhe. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.5. <hi>For this purpoſe appeared the Sonne of GOD, that hee might take away our ſinnes, and that hee might looſe the woorkes of the Diuell.</hi> Therefore the Son is God, and another nature from the fleſh; that is, the man Ieſus is the ſonne of God in reſpect not only of his humanity, but alſo of his diuinity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and before the fleſhe, exiſted in him, and by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the fleſh was made as it were viſible and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:19538:248"/>
conſpicuous. Wherefore it followeth alſo, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that that was a ſubſiſtent and a perſon. For <hi>that which is by nature a ſonne, is alſo a perſon. But Chriſtes diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or nature which was alſo before his fleſh, is the Sonne of God by nature. Therefore it is a ſubſiſtent and a perſon in the fleſh taken or aſſumpted, and before it.</hi>

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:19538:256"/>
confirmeth in the place afore ſignified, where he aſcribeth thoſe thinges to wiſedome, which fall not into any, but which is ſubſiſting, liuing, and working; as, that it ſubſiſted in God before things were created, that it was begotten, and ſo foorth.

                        <hi>To the ſixt claſſe,</hi> beelong thoſe places of Scripture, <hi>which ſpeake of the of the of the Mediatour.</hi> The Argument is this. <hi>The Mediatour, without whoſe merite and preſent efficacie, there coulde bee no friendſhip or amitie ioined betweene God and ſinfullmen,</hi>

Whence it is neceſſarily prooued
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:19538:256"/>
that Chriſt was before his incarnation: for there cannot be friendſhip betweene God and men without a Mediator now exiſting or being. But in the old Teſtament there was friendſhip betweene God &amp; men, that is, beleeuers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either he, or ſome other was Mediator of that Church: there was no other, but he only, becauſe <hi>there is but one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 1. Tim. 2.5. But that there cannot bee any amitie betweene God and men without a Mediator now alreadie being, ſhall alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that which foloweth. For <hi>it is the office and function of the Mediator,</hi> not onely by deprecation or intreaty, &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to appeaſe &amp; pacifie the father, but alſo to conferre &amp; beſtow al the benefits, which he obtaineth, by his power &amp; efficacie, vpon beleeuers, to make the wil of god known vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to inſtitute a miniſterie, to collect, gather, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the church, &amp; that wholy. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath known the father, but the ſon, &amp; he to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſon wil reueil him.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither did Adam knowe god but by the ſonne, &amp; by a conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſon exiſted at that time.

beginning of the woorlde did reueile the will of God vnto men, appoint and ordaine a miniſterie, collect, gouerne and ſaue his Church, whereof he is the builder: which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is apparent that he hath done from the beginning of the Churches birth, it is not to be doubted of, that he hath alwaies beene ſubſiſting. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the fathers will, that of all which hee hath giuen me, I ſhoulde looſe nothing.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſaueth his Church, and therefore hath alwaies beene, becauſe the Church hath alwaies beene ſaued and preſerued.</p>

The Prophet Malachie hath a notable teſtimonie, cap. 3.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me, and the Lord, whom yee ſeeke, ſhall ſpeedily come to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: euen the meſſenger of the couenaunt whom yee deſire.</hi> This ſpeaketh Chriſt himſelf by the Prophet, which is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by this Argument: Whoſe way is prepared, he is Chriſt: but he that promiſeth, is he whoſe way is prepared. Therefore he that promiſeth is Chriſt. The Maior is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: for not the Father, but Chriſt was looked for, and he followed Iohn Baptiſt. The Minor is prooued out of the text it ſelfe. <hi>Beholde I will ſend my meſſenger, and hee ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way before me.</hi> Wherfore Chriſt was before he tooke fleſhe, becauſe hee ſent his meſſenger, and was alſo before he tooke fleſh, very God. <hi>For hee calleth it his Temple, to which he ſaieth hee will come.</hi> But none hath a Temple builded in worſhip of him but god: therefore it is blaſphemous to ſay, that Chriſt was not before he tooke fleſhe. Neither doth that hinder, becauſe he ſpeaketh in the third perſon. <hi>The Lord will come to his Temple.</hi> For he ſufficiently ſheweth who that Lord is, namely not the Father, but the ſonne. <hi>I the Lord who ſend Iohn bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Vnto the ſonne hee ſaith, O God, thy throne is for euer and euer.</hi> Heb. 3. <hi>Chriſt Ieſus is the Apoſtle, and high Prieſt, the builder, heire and Lord of his Church.</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, the ſame is alſo for euer.</hi> The Argument therefore is this. <hi>The meſſenger or Angel ſent of olde vnto the Church, was a ſubſiſtent, or perſon. That meſſenger is the ſonne of God Chriſt. Therefore the ſonne of God was, before Ieſus was borne of the Virgin, truely exiſting, did worke, and was ruler ouer his church.</hi> The Minor is proued; Firſt, <hi>becauſe to bee God, and to be ſent of God, for to teach, collect, gouerne and ſaue the church, that is, to bee the Mediatour, are thinges proper vnto the ſonne of God Chriſt, not to the Father, or the holy Ghoſt. But theſe properties of the ſonne are attributed to this meſſenger or Angel, as author and effectour,</hi> Exo. 3. and 4. Gen. 32.28.30. Gen. 48.15.16. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>the Apoſtle Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 10. <hi>teacheth Chriſt to haue beene preſent with the people of Iſraell in the deſert, and to haue beene tempted and prouoked by them.

                        <note place="margin">The diuine Nature in Chriſt both was before the fleſh, and is the ſonne of God.</note> are conteined thoſe teſtimonies of Scripture, <hi>which affirme Chriſt Jeſus to be by nature god, and the ſonne of god.</hi> The Argument is this: <hi>Chriſts Diuinitie exiſted before Jeſus borne of the Virgin. Chriſts Diuinitie is the ſonne of god. Therefore the ſonne of god exiſted before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was borne.</hi> The Maior of this Argument is confirmed by the reaſons alreadie alleadged. For firſt, <hi>God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh which hee tooke.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Chriſt is the proper or naturall ſonne of god, and not man onelie.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is the woorde.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt is that wiſedome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</hi> Fiftly, <hi>CHRIST is the Mediatour.</hi> Sixtly, <hi>CHRIST is that Meſſenger or Angell ſent of olde to his Church.</hi> And to theſe reaſons commeth the ſeuenth: That <hi>in Chriſt is not anie created god-head, but that eternall Deitie, which alone is true god. For vnto Chriſt not onelie the name, but all the properties alſo and perfections of the true god are euerie where aſcribed in ſcripture: as omnipotencie, infinite wiſedome, omniſcience, or all knowledge, immenſitie, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and gouernaunce of thinges, the ſaluation of the Church, the woorking of miracles,</hi> Romans, 9.5.1. Timothie. 3.16. Iſai. 9.6. Ieremie, 23.6. and elſewhere. And the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:19538:258"/>
and giuing vnto him of the properties of the true God yeeldeth vs a more firme proofe of his Diuinitie, than dooth the attributing of the name of the true God, or of the Lord. For the names of God may after a ſort be expounded metaphoricallie: but the Diuine propertie attributed vnto Chriſt can not bee wreſted to any other meaning. If therefore wee fence and gard our ſelues with ſuch teſtimonies; the aduerſaries of this Doctrine cannot conſiſt, or ſtand; but, will they, nill they, they ſhall bee forced to confeſſe that Chriſt was before hee tooke fleſhe. And if hee were before hee tooke fleſhe; hee was either the Creator, or a creature. But he was no creature: both becauſe he created all thinges: and becauſe alſo hee is called creator. Wherefore ſeeing the true GOD hath beene from euerlaſting, his Godhead alſo, which is true God, muſt needes be <hi>ſubſiſting</hi> from euerlaſting.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is likewiſe confirmed by the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. 1. <hi>The nature which tooke fleſh is GOD, and the Sonne of GOD. For neither the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt tooke fleſh: Therefore the Sonne; otherwiſe the Sonne of God is not by nature GOD.</hi> 2. <hi>The humane nature in Chriſt is not the naturall ſonne of GOD. Therefore the Diuine nature muſt bee that ſonne.</hi> 3. <hi>The Diuine nature in Chriſt is the Worde.</hi> 4. <hi>Jt is Wiſedome.</hi> 5. <hi>According to it Chriſt is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</hi> 6. <hi>The Deitie of Chriſt is the Angel and meſſenger of the Lord, ſent of olde vnto the Church. Therefore the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie of Chriſt, is the ſonne of God.</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there cannot be three perſons of the godhead.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is true of an eſſence created &amp; finite; that can not, beeing one, be the ſame and whole ſubſtance of three, or bee three: but it is falſe, of the infinite, moſt ſimple, and indiuiduall eſſence of the Godhead. For this as it exiſteth one and whole together in many, nay in infinit places and thinges, ſo may it be, remaining one, the ſame and whole eſſence of moe: yea and moreouer it is neceſſarie ſo to be: ſeeing the generation of the Sonne, and the proceeding of the holy ghoſt, is the communicating of the eſſence of the Father.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>Whoſe operations are diſtinct, their eſſences alſo muſt needes be diſtinct. The internall operations of the father, the ſon, and holy ghoſt are diſtinct. Therefore they haue alſo diſtinct eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Anſwere. The Maior of this reaſon is true of perſons hauing a finite eſſence: but being vnderſtood of the diuine
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:19538:264"/>
perſons it is falſe, if it be ment of thoſe internal operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whereof the Minor ſpeaketh. Wherefore inuerting the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior, we return it back vpon the aduerſaries themſelues. For whereas the internal operations, namely the generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſon, &amp; the proceeding of the holy ghoſt, are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of the fathers eſſence whole &amp; the ſame in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: it muſt needs be that there is not a diuerſe or diſtinct, but one diuine eſſence of al three perſons.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <hi>That which hath a beginning is not eternal: But the ſon and the holy ghoſt haue their beginning or originall from the father, therefore they are not eternal.</hi> Aunſwere. That is not eternall which hath a beginning of eſſence or nature and time. But the ſon and the holy ghoſt haue a beginning or original of perſon or order, or of the maner of exiſting, but not of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For this they haue one &amp; the ſame in number with the father from euerlaſting: &amp; that is void of al beginning and original, and exiſteth neceſſarily from no other but of it ſelfe. Reply. <hi>But he who hath his originall of perſon from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not Iehoua. But the ſon and the holy ghoſt haue their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of perſon from the father. Therefore they are not Iehoua.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. The Maior is a falſe ground. For the ſcripture dooth plainly teach both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely, both the ſon &amp; the holie ghoſt to be Iehoua. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he giuen likewiſe to the ſon to haue life in himſelfe:</hi> &amp; yet the ſcripture withall affirmeth, that both haue their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of perſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father.

There is more in the concluſion than in the premiſſes. For the particle ONLIE, which is ſtitched to the concluſion, is not in the Minor propoſition. Wherefore of a Minor which is but particular, an vniuerſal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion is ill inferred, after this maner.

Wherefore we ſaie, That the faithfull are one with

For the diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is incarnate only in one of the perſons, which is the ſonne: not in al three.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 <hi>The ſonne is Mediatour with Iehoua. But the ſon is Iehoua. Therefore Iehoua is Mediator with himſelfe.</hi> Anſwer. Nothing followeth of mere particulars.

Iehoua is not taken in the ſame ſignification in both the premiſſes.

               <p>Whereby three thinges are ſignified. 1. <hi>That the maſſe of his humane nature was created or formed, in the wombe of the Virgin, miraculouſlie, and beſide the order of thinges diſpoſed of God in nature, by the immediate working &amp; operation of the holy Ghoſt; without the ſeede and ſubſtance of man.</hi> Obiection. <hi>But we are alſo formed and made of God.</hi> Anſwere.

Firſt, <hi>that hee might bee a pure ſacrifice and a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ranſome for our redemption,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.12. <hi>He hath made him to be ſinne for vs, which knew no ſinne, that we ſhould be made the righteouſnes of god in him.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That he might alſo ſanctify vs by his ſanctitie and holyneſſe.</hi> For if Chriſt had beene a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee could not haue ſatisfied for vs, but himſelfe ſhould haue remained in death. Therefore could he not haue bin our ſanctifier, neither by merit, nor by his power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie. Heb. 2.11. <hi>For he that ſanstifieth, and they that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are all of one.</hi> Heb. 7.26. <hi>Such an high Prieſt it became vs to haue, which is holy, harmeleſſe, vndefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Iohn was not agreeable vnto the Word the eternall ſonne of god, to vnite perſonallie vnto him humane nature being ſtained &amp; defiled, where in hee dwelleth as in his owne temple. For God is a conſuming fire.</hi> Fourthly. <hi>That wee might know, that whatſoeuer this ſonne ſpeaketh, it is the will of God, and the truth. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is borne of fleſh,</hi> which is ſinful, and not ſanctified, <hi>is fleſh,</hi> falſhood and vanitie.

The Holy Ghoſt doth beſt know how to ſeuer ſinne from mans nature, for ſinne is not of the nature of

man, but came elſe-whence, euen from the Diuel. Mary therefore was a ſinner, but that maſſe of fleſh which was taken out of her ſubſtaunce, was by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt at the ſame inſtant ſanctified when it was taken.</p>
               <p>The third thing which is ſignified,<note place="margin">3 The vniting of his fleſh vnto his Godhead.</note> in that Chriſt is ſaide to bee conceiued by the holie Ghoſt, <hi>is the vnion of the humane nature with the Woorde.</hi> For the fleſhe of Chriſt was together both created or formed, and alſo ſanctified and vnited to the Sonne, of the holy Ghoſt immediatelie, but of the Father and the Sonne by the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>It is added furder in the Creede,<note place="margin">Born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> that he was <hi>borne of the Virgine Mary,</hi> that is, of the Virgins ſubſtance: and that cheifely for theſe cauſes.</p>

For that being immenſe &amp; infinit is euery where, nether doth a remouing from one place to another agree vnto it; it is not laid downe, and taken vp again, that is, it neuer departed or was ſeuered from the body, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth alwaies vnited vnto it. Wherefore there muſt needs be in Chriſt, beſides his body &amp; his Godhead, a true humane ſoule, which did truely ſuffer and abide in Chriſt theſe chaunges and the like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is confirmed by diuine promiſes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. <hi>For the Meſſias in the old Teſtament was promiſed to be ſuch a one, as ſhould be the ſeede of the woman, of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, &amp;c. But this Ieſus, the Sonne of the Virgine Mary, is that promiſed Meſſias. Therefore he muſt needs bee true man, iſſuing of the bloode and poſterity of the woman and the Fathers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to haue been indeede begotten of the ſubſtance of Marie, and to haue taken true fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The office of the Mediatour confirmeth the ſame. <hi>The ſinne of men in reſpect of gods truth and iuſtice, could not bee puniſhed in any other nature, than in a humane nature, which ſhoulde bee of the ſame kind with ours. But in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour which is Jeſus Chriſt alone, our ſinnes were to bee puniſhed. Therefore he muſt needes bee true man, who hath humane fleſh,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:19538:270"/>
not created of nothing, or borne elſe-whence, but ſprong from the bloud of Adam, as well as ours.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>Jt was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for Chriſt not onelie to take, but alſo to retaine our nature for euer:</hi> Becauſe GOD hath decreed to beſtowe, and dooth beſtowe the benefites, which Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed for vs, by this man CHRIST vpon them onely, who are and remain engraffed into his maſſe and fleſh, as members into their head, or braunches into their vine. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> Iohn. 15.6. <hi>Jf a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide not in me, he is caſt forth as a braunch and withereth</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Jt behoued Chriſt to be made and to continue our brother for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> that as he is fleſh of our fleſh, ſo we alſo of the otherſide might be fleſh &amp; bones of his fleſh and bones, by the ſame ſpirite dwelling in vs. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are members of his bodie, of his fleſh, and of his bones.</hi> Iohn. 5.56. Eph. 4.12.16. Rom. 8.11. &amp;c. Wherefore except Chriſt had indeede taken our nature, without which hee cannot be our brother, we ſhoulde looſe that comfort euer needefull and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for vs, which conſiſteth in the Brotherhood onely of Chriſt with vs: I am of his fleſh and of his bones.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Obiection. <hi>The fleſh of Adam (that is, humane fleſh iſſuing from Adam by generation vnto his poſteritie) is ſinnefull. The fleſh of Chriſt is not ſinnefull, therefore the fleſh of Chriſt, is not the fleſh of Adam.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior propoſition hath a fallacie of the accident. For it is not neceſſarie, that of whatſoeuer the accident of a thing is denied, of the ſame the thing alſo or ſubiect of the accident ſhoulde bee denied: becauſe an accident dooth ſo cleaue to the thing wherein it is, as it may bee ſeparated from it. Sinne is not of the eſſence and nature of humane fleſh: for that was created pure of God: but ſinne came otherwiſe, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection &amp; falling of our firſt parents from god. Seeing then the fleſh of Adam is ſinfull only by an accident, it foloweth that the fleſh of Chriſt is onely in reſpect of that accident not the fleſh of Adam, but is as touching the ſubſtaunce the ſame fleſh with the fleſh of Adam. Wherefore they deale like Sophiſters, who denie the fleſh of CHRIST, for that it is voide of ſinne, to bee the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, or Eſſence, or kinde, with the fleſh of Adam.
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:19538:271"/>
For hee that coulde in the beginning create humane fleſh pure of nothing, is able alſo by his omnipotent power, and ſpeciall working ſo to forme it of the ſubſtaunce of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin being a ſinner, as withall to let and ſtop any iſſuing of ſinne thereunto, that is, to make it pure and holy. There is no new or ſtrange thing therefore, if the omnipotent Lord hath tooke humane ſubſtance, without the accident, ſinne, into the vnity of his perſon. Wherefore this their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhalbe rather thus inuerted: <hi>The fleſh of Adam is true fleſh. Chriſts fleſh is the fleſh of Adam: therefore Chriſts fleſh is true fleſh: and by a conſequent, Chriſt is true man:</hi> as alſo the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mediatour did require, that he ſhould both bee and continue true man. For ſeeing true men had ſinned, he was to be true man that ſhoulde make ſatisfaction. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt bee one and the ſame Mediatour, who muſt alwaies make interceſſion vnto the father for vs, and hee muſt euer continue ſuch, that is, true and very man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Obiection. <hi>That which is conceiued and begotten of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is of the ſame ſubſtance with him. The fleſh of Chriſt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the holie Ghoſt. Therefore the fleſh of Chriſt is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but came downe from heauen, iſſuing from the ſubſtaunce of God.</hi> Aunſwere. There is a fallacie in the diuers vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the particle OF. For that in the Maior ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the matter or material cauſe, in the Minor the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe onely, that is: That which is conceiued or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of another, transfuſing or paſſing his ſubſtance, or part of his ſubſtaunce into the thing begotten: this is of the ſame eſſence with him who begot it: CHRISTS fleſhe was conceiued by the Holy GHOST, not that hee transfuſed or paſſed his ſubſtaunce into the fleſh begotten, but becauſe in miraculous ſort, hee formed in the Virgins wombe of her ſubſtance the body of Chriſt, ſo that it ſhould not be contaminated or polluted with ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſinne. For neither could Chriſt bee in that ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the holy Ghoſt, as that his fleſhe ſhoulde iſſue from the ſpirits ſubſtance: and that for theſe cauſes. 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if this were graunted, then were he not borne man of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or propagated of the Virgins ſubſtance.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe God is not changed into fleſh.</hi> 3. <hi>Becauſe the Word tooke the fleſh, but was not changed into it.</hi>

Meere particulars doe enforce nothing. For if the Maior bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vniuerſallie, it is falſe: whoſoeuer is God, in him are not two natures: this generall propoſition is falſe. The Maior therefore is true, as touching God the father, and God the holy Ghoſt, but not as touching God the ſonne incarnate. Replie 1. <hi>But nothing can bee added vnto God, by reaſon of the great perfection and ſimplicitie of his nature.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 Obiection. <hi>Jn whom are two things which in themſelues make two whole perſons, in him alſo are two perſons. But in Chriſt are two things which make two whole perſons; namely the Word,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:19538:272"/>
which is by it ſelfe a perſon, ſubſiſting from all eternitie, and the bodie and ſoule, which beeing vnited make likewiſe a perſon. Therefore in Chriſt are two perſons.</hi> Aunſwere. We denie that part of the Maior, to wit, <hi>That the bodie and humane ſoule doe, as in other men, ſo alſo in Chriſt concurre to make a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated perſon of the humane nature, and diuers from the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create and eternall of the Woordc.</hi> For albeit the humane nature in Chriſt compounded of a bodie and a reaſonable ſoule, is an indiuidual and particular or ſingular ſubſtance, as being from other indiuiduals of the ſame nature diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by certaine properties and accidents: yet neither was it or is it a perſon or ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <hi>A perſon is that which is not onelie a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or ſingular thing, but alſo it ſelfe conſiſteth and ſubſiſteth in it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, not ſuſteined in or of anie other.

                  </p>
                  <p>Anſ. The Maior propoſition, if it bee vnderſtood ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie or vniuerſally, is falſe. For a reaſonable ſoule, exiſting in the bodie, is not a perſon, but a part of an humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which the ſoule together with the bodie doth make: yet notwithſtanding the ſame ſoule, being looſed from the bodie, is a perſon by it ſelfe, not that compound and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

perſon, whereof it was a part, that is, an humane perſon, but a perſon moſt ſimple and immortall, ſuch as are the Angels: becauſe it ſubſiſteth out of the bodie by it ſelf, neither is part of another. So <hi>may it be ſaid of the Word,</hi> if it be conſtred aright &amp; with indifferencie, <hi>that the Word in it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe is not the whole perſon of Chriſt or the Mediatour, as he is Chriſt and Mediatour;</hi> that is, is not that whole thing, which is Chriſt, who is not onely God, but alſo man; <hi>and yet is in it ſelfe and by it ſelfe the perfect and whole perſon of the Godhead, truelie ſubſiſting before the fleſh was, that is, the onelie begotten ſonne of God.</hi> For this ſelfe ſame perſon exiſting in it ſelfe from euerlaſting, and remaining for euer moſt ſimple and vncompound, is, by the aſſuming of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, made in time after a ſort compound, that is, the <hi>Word</hi> incarnate. <hi>Wherefore in reſpect of the perſon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Vnion, or incarnate, the Word is rather conſidered as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and both it ſelfe, and the humane nature may be called as it were the parts of whole Chriſt,</hi> &amp; are ſo called alſo of many of the auncient Fathers which were ſound in faith, not that the fleſh aſſumpted did adde any part to the ſubſiſtence of the <hi>Word:</hi> or as if of the Perſons of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as being vnperfect parts, was made another perfect perſon of a certaine third Eſſence, conſubſtantiall with neither of thoſe natures of which it is compounded: but becauſe the perſon of the <hi>Word</hi> altogether one and the ſame, which before the fleſh was taken conſiſted in the diuine nature onely, doth now after the taking of the fleſh, ſubſiſt in two perfect natures, diuine and humane, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no commixtion, confuſion, or mutation: that is, <hi>The perſon of the Mediatour is ſaide to bee conſtituted of two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, diuine and humane, as it were of partes, becauſe thoſe two are neceſſarilie required, and doe concurre to the abſoluing and accompliſhing of the woorke of our redemption.</hi> In this ſenſe therefore both by auncient, and latter Diuines, and alſo by Schoolemen are vſed well and without daunger theſe Phraſes and ſpeeches: <hi>Chriſts perſon is compounded: The two nature are, as it were the partes of Chriſt: The perſon of Chriſt is, conſiſteth, is conſtituted, is made of or in the two natures of God and man: the two natures concurre, come together into one perſon and ſubſiſtence: they make one hypoſtaſis or ſubſiſtence:
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:19538:273"/>
Both natures belong, and concur to the ſubſtance of one Chriſt: Both are of the ſubſtance of Chriſt: the humanitie with the Worde, or contrarie, the diuine perſon or ſubſiſtence with the humane nature doth conſtitute or make the ſubſtance of one Chriſt.

Firſt, if, <hi>that which ſubſiſteth by it ſelfe,</hi> be oppoſed to an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which exiſteth by being in another: this part of the Minor Propoſition is falſe, that Chriſts humanity doth not ſubſiſt by it ſelfe: becauſe that alſo is a ſubſtance. But in this diſputation, <hi>Subſiſting by it ſelfe,</hi> is oppoſed to that, which is indeede ſubſtance, but yet dependeth of another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in another.

Wherefore for further aunſwere wee ſay, that the Maior propoſition, beeing ſimplie, and generallie taken, is falſe. For the ſoule of man beeing looſed from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, dooth ſubſiſt by it ſelfe; the ſame, while it remaineth in the bodie, conſiſteth not by it ſelfe, but vnited with the bodie: Neither yet is it therefore to bee thought more vnperfect, when this rather dooth moſt make to the perfection thereof. For it is created of GOD to this purpoſe, that it ſhoulde together with the bodie conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtute and abſolue the Eſſence of man, and ſhoulde bee a part thereof. So the ſoule and bodie of CHRIST were created to that ende, as to bee the proper ſoule and bodie of the ſonne of GOD, and to depende perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie of him. That therefore CHRISTS huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie hath his ſubſiſtence not in a created perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto it by nature, but in the eternall hypoſtaſis and perſon of the Worde: it is ſo farre from bringing any imperfection thereunto (for the ſubſiſtence or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubſiſting doth not change the nature or eſſence of a thing) that rather the greateſt ornament, glorie, and eminencie commeth thereby vnto it: and this is the chiefe and principall difference, whereby it differeth and is diſcerned from all men, and alſo from the bleſſed Angels.</p>

                     <p>By this which hath beene ſaide, it is manifeſt, <hi>That the Vnion in nature and naturall perfections, is an equalitie of properties and nature: but the perſonall Vnion is, when two vnlike natures are coupled, ſo that each reteineth his naturall properties and operations whole and diſtinct, but yet haue both one and the ſame ſubſiſtence wholie: or, it is the ioining of two natures different in properties, to conſtitute the ſubſtaunce of one indiuiduall, or perſon,</hi> that is, ſuch a connexion and knitting of them together, as that they are one indiuiduall ſubſiſting by it ſelfe, or the ſubſtaunce of one indiuiduall.</p>
                     <p>But that in Chriſt <hi>the Vnion of the fleſh with the Woorde
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:19538:275"/>
is not eſſentiall, made in the nature, or anie eſſentiall propertie of the God-head,</hi> is ſhewed by theſe reaſons. Firſt, <hi>Of the God-head and the fleſhe aſſumpted, there ariſeth not anie third Eſſence: but eache is and abideth an Eſſence ſo perfect and whole, as neither</hi> (eſpeciallie the Diuine, as beeing in it ſelfe a perſon and ſimplie voide of all change) <hi>commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the compoſition or compounding (as wee properlie take this Word) of the other,</hi> Secondly, <hi>Jf the Vnion of the fleſhe with the Word were eſſentiall; it would follow, that the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie once aſſumpted and taken was equalled with the Godhead, in eſſentiall properties, and ſo by a conſequent, to bee made of the ſame nature &amp; eſſence with the Word.</hi> So Vigilius in his fourth booke ſheweth, <hi>that the Eutychians held two ſubſtances to be in Chriſt of the ſame nature.</hi> Wherefore they who will haue the eſſential properties of the Godhead to be reallie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and common with the fleſhe, ſo that the fleſhe ſhoulde truely and reallie bee, and bee called omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, omniſcient, and whatſoeuer elſe the God-head is: they indeede, howſoeuer in woordes they mightily ſtand againſt it, holde this Vnion to bee made in eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and in nature, and both with <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Schwenckfield,</hi> they confounde both natures, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the difference betweene the creature and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; and alſo with Neſtorius they frame and make two perſons, and ſo bring in a quaternitie. For albeit they ſay, that they in that their confuſion, or as themſelues call it with their Maſter <hi>Schwenkfield,</hi> Deifiyng and Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall exaltation of the fleſhe, doe retaine the ſubſtance of the fleſhe: yet two ſubſtaunces hauing reallie the ſame and like perfections are two <hi>Subſiſtents</hi> or perſons of one nature, as are two men, and whatſoeuer other indiuidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the ſame kind or nature. Laſtly with <hi>Sabellius</hi> and the <hi>Patripaſſians</hi> they incarnate the whole Trinitie. For there is one and the ſame Eſſence in number of the diuine perſons, and the ſame eſſential properties. Wherefore that which is vnited, and equalled with one of theſe three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to eſſence, muſt needes be alſo vnited and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore the Vnion of both natures in Chriſt is perſonall, or according to the ſubſiſtence proper vnto the Word, both natures
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:19538:275"/>
keeping and retaining, in that vnion, their properties whole and vnconfounded.</hi> For the <hi>Word</hi> did not, by vniting humane nature vnto it, make the ſame the Godhead, or GOD, and omnipotent, immenſe, and infinite: but it tooke the manhood which reteineth ſtill the properties belonging vnto it, and ſo did ioine and knitte it vnto it ſelfe, as to bee one perſon with it, and the ſubſtaunce of one Chriſt. Neither is it abſurd, that a thing which neither is made or is one with another in kinde, neither any <hi>Homogeneal</hi> part thereof, ſhoulde yet exiſt in the ſame ſubſiſtence with it, or ſhoulde ſubſiſt in it ſelfe, where-with it is vnited. For a graffe hath his ſubſiſting in a tree of another nature or kinde. The ſame is the ſubſiſtence both of the ſprig, engraffed, and of the tree ſuſteining the ſprig: that is, they are one and the ſame indiuiduall tree, yet haue they and ſo doe retaine natures in properties moſt diuers. The like reaſon is there in the two natures of Chriſt both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in or of the ſame perſon of the ſonne.</p>
                     <p>Obiection. <hi>The humane nature is vnited with the Word in perſon, but not in nature. Therefore the perſon is diuorced and ſundered from the nature.</hi> Againe, <hi>The perſon onelie of the ſonne is vnited with the humane nature: therefore not the diuine nature it ſelfe of the Word.</hi> Aunſwere. In both theſe Arguments is a fallacie from that which is no cauſe, as if it were a cauſe, and both offend in this: for that they who ſo reaſon againſt the maintainers of true doctrine, and men ſounde in faith, either knowe not, or are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſtinguiſh betweene theſe two Phraſes of ſpeech, <hi>To bee vnited in nature,</hi> and, <hi>to be vnited too or with a nature:</hi> when notwithſtanding the difference is very great, and moſt familiar, and knowne vnto the ſchoolemen. For to bee vnited in nature, is to bee equalled, that is, to bee made one eſſence or nature with another: To bee vnited too or with a nature, is to bee coupled and ioined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to one ſubſiſtence or perſonalitie. <hi>Wherefore the fleſhe is vnited to or with the the Woorde, not in nature, or in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall propertie,</hi> that is, it is not made with the Woorde one eſſence, neither made equall vnto it in omnipotency, wiſedome, and nature: for ſo ſhoulde the whole Trinitie bee incarnate: <hi>Yet is it vnited to the omnipotencie, wiſedome,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:19538:276"/>
nature and eſſence of God, not ſimplie, but of god the Worde.</hi> Now this is nothing elſe, than the fleſh to be vnited to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſonne, or to the <hi>Worde</hi> in perſon, which perſon is the verie diuine nature or eſſence, omnipotent, wiſe, and whatſoeuer elſe is proper to the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>But albeit the fleſh taken or aſſumpted is truely vnited both to the perſon and to the nature of the Word: For the perſon is not any ſeuerall thing, or reallie differing from the eſſence, but is the eſſence it ſelfe: yet is it well ſaide, <hi>that the fleſh is vnited to the Word in perſon only:</hi> and Likewiſe, <hi>that the perſon onely of the Word is incarnate.</hi> The reaſons hereof are, 1. <hi>Becauſe not the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt were incarnate but the ſonne onely.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe the firſt and neereſt terme of this vnion is the perſon onely of the Word aſſuming and taking the fleſh, but not the Godhead.</hi> For the perſon onely is proper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Word: the eſſence of the Godhead is common to him and the ſame with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt. This is plainely taught by the 6. Toletan Councel, Cap. 1. in theſe wordes: <hi>The ſon onely tooke the humanitie in ſingularity of perſon, not in vnitie of diuine nature, that is, in that, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto the ſon, not which is common to the Trinitie.</hi> And Ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus in his dialog againſt the Acephaliſts: <hi>Not god the Word by the diuine nature, but the diuine nature by the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god the Word is ſaid to be vnited to the fleſh.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both God the Woorde and his nature is incarnate: hee by him ſelfe, &amp; in that he is himſelfe: his nature not ſo, but by the perſon. God the Word then as touching himſelfe is vnited to the fleſh, for he is made one perſon and one ſubſiſtence with the fleſh; but as touching his nature hee is conioyned rather than vnited: becauſe there remaine ſtill two natures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore either foule &amp; ſhamefull is the follie, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious the malice and ſlaunder of certaine ſmatterers, that of this verie orthodoxall and ſound poſition not of the ſchoolmen onely, but of Councels alſo and auncient Fathers, <hi>The fleſh is vnited to the Word, in perſon onely, or according to ſubſiſtence; and this onely maketh the proper diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of perſonall vnion:</hi> they inffer, <hi>that by this meanes the diuine nature of the Woorde is drawen away from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall vnion.</hi> But let them againe and againe looke vnto it, leaſt by that their reall communicating of the eſſentiall
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:19538:276"/>
properties of the Godhead (which are the verie diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence common to the ſonne with the Father and the holy Ghoſt) which communication they will haue to bee the perſonall vnion which they define by it, they ouerthrowe as well the eternall Godhead of Chriſt man, as alſo the manhood it ſelfe; and withall plainlie incarnate the whole Trinitie.</p>
                     <p>That then one and the ſame Chriſt is, and is called tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reallie <hi>the verie eternall God, immenſe, omnipotent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour;</hi> and <hi>true naturall man, finite, weake, ſubiect to paſſions and ſufferinges, and a creature:</hi> the onely cauſe is the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perſon ſubſiſting in two natures perfect, whole, and reallie diſtinct, diuine and humane. For euerie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall and perſon is denominated or named of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or formes, and their properties and operations, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring or ſubſiſting in it. Wherefore ſeeing in the ſame indiuiduall perſon of the <hi>Word</hi> doe truely ſubſiſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſubſtance of one Chriſt, theſe two moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers natures: vnto one and the ſame Chriſt, of which ſoeuer nature he be called, do agree, &amp; are affirmed of him all the attributes and properties both diuine and humane, but after a diuerſe manner. <hi>For the attributes which agree to Chriſt in reſpect of the perſonall vnion,</hi> are of two ſorts: <hi>ſome are attributes or properties of the natures: others, of his office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The naturall attributes are thoſe which are proper to ech na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whether the ſame bee eſſentiall, belonging to the eſſence of the thing, or which neceſſarily followe &amp; accompanie it, without which the nature can not conſiſt: or accidentall, which may bee away and wanting, without the deſtruction of the nature.</hi> The eſſentiall properties and perfections of the Godhead are, <hi>to be eternall, vncreate, immenſe, euerie where preſent, not to be circumſcribed in place, omnipotent, omniſcient, and the like,</hi> which are the verie eſſence of the Godhead, as alſo <hi>to create, to giue the Holy Ghoſt, to regenerate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The eſſentiall attributes</hi> of the humanity are, <hi>to haue a ſoule vnderſtanding, immortall; and a body compounded of elements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of skinne, bloud, fleſh, bones, veines and ſinowes, hauing a certaine and definite greateneſſe, figure, proportion and collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or localnes of partes: and therefore to be circumſcried in one place, to be ſolid, viſible, palpable and ſuch like.</hi> Theſe Chriſt
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:19538:277"/>
reteineth for euer, becauſe without theſe nothing can bee a humane nature. <hi>The accidental properties</hi> of the humanitie are <hi>thoſe infirmities which enſued vpon ſinne,</hi> which infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Chriſt together with the humane nature it ſelfe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and tooke without ſinne.

                     <p>The attributes <hi>of his office</hi> are called thoſe, <hi>which agree not to one nature onely, but to both together, that is, it agreeth to the whole perſon, according to both natures, as being the compound of both.</hi>

                           <hi>BOTH natures, and their properties are truely and reallie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the perſon and of themſelues interchangeably, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete termes or voices: yet ſo, that the proper predicate which is proper vnto one nature is attributed to the perſon, not according to both natures, but according to that onely, to which it is proper.</hi> The reaſon is, <hi>for that one and the ſame perſon ſubſisting in two natures, hath and reteineth for euer reallie the properties of both natures: and alſo becauſe one and the ſame perſon is ſignified by the concrete voices of both natures.</hi> As therefore one &amp; the ſame man is liuing and corporeal according to diuerſe natures: and the corporeal is liuing by the ſoule onely, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie, the liuing is corporeall by the bodie onely: For both ſoul and bodie are of the ſubſtance and eſſence of the ſame man: So likewiſe <hi>one &amp; the ſame Chriſt, is God, eternal, immenſe, omnipotent,</hi> according to the God-head onely: <hi>is man, the Virgines ſonne, created, finite infirme, and did ſuffer,</hi> according to his humanity onely: So likewiſe <hi>God is man, borne of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, annointed with the holy Ghoſt, and ſuffered,</hi> according to the fleſh; And <hi>man is God, eternal, creatour, omnipotent, giueth the holie Ghoſt,</hi> not according to the humane nature, but according to the diuine.

                        <p>Wherefore theſe kindes of ſpeaches are falſe: <hi>The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is the manhoode or man; was conceiued, borne, did ſuffer, was dead:</hi> and againe theſe: <hi>The Man-hoode is the God-head or God; is eternal, immenſe, vncircumſcribed in place, omnipotent, giueth the holie Ghoſt, dooth regenerate.</hi> For al theſe are no more true and to be admitted, than thoſe: A ſoule is a bodie, or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, mortal, viſible; and, a body is a ſoul, or a ſpirit, inuiſible, immortal.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Obiection. <hi>The whole perſon of Chriſt is really omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, euerie where, eternal &amp;c.

in properties eſſentiall, or which get and haue the ſame or equall eſſential properties, are indeede made one nature and ſubſtance, or are two ſubſtaunces of one nature.</hi> Both opinions take cleane away the nature of the humanitie &amp; transform it into the God-head: but the latter dooth further make two perſons in Chriſt of the ſame nature. It is alſo <hi>Sophisticall: becauſe whether the perſon of Chriſt be conſidered in it ſelfe, as it was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being but one and perfect, &amp; that before the incarnation, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in one nature onely: or whether it bee conſidered, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and now ſubſiſting in two natures: yet stil the tranſition and paſſing from the perſon to the natures is faultie and Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical.

So not halfe, but the whole perſon of Chriſt was before Abraham, and from euerlaſting did create and dooth preſerue all thinges, and tooke fleſh: But the fleſhe neither was from euerlaſting, neither did create, nor dooth preſerue all thinges; nor tooke fleſh, but was created, and being aſſumpted and taken is ſuſteined of the <hi>Word,</hi> and in it. So whole chriſt was wounded, &amp; dead, yet not his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head nor his ſoul.

the ſame ſhoulde bee both proper and common, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie a manifeſt contradiction.

For to be proper and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are contradictory &amp; therfore in fardeſt repugnancie.</p>
                        <p>Thirdlie, <hi>There can not be made, one omnipotencie, and one omnipotent operation to be of both natures, whereby as well the manhood, as the Godhead, ſhould be reallie omnipotent and worke diuine thinges: but there muſt needes be alſo one eſſence of both, whereby the manhood alſo must bee reallie God.</hi> For the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, which they wil haue one and the ſame to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto the fleſh, is the Godhead it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="548" facs="tcp:19538:283"/>Fourthly, <hi>If Christs humanitie, in the office of the Mediator, doth it ſelfe reallie &amp; effectuallie perfourme not onely that which belongeth vnto the fleſh, but alſo thoſe thinges which are proper vnto the Godhead, then either his Godhead ſhall bee idle and doe nothing in the woorke of our redemption, or ſurelie the fleſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpted ſhall doe more, and more ſhall be due and yeelded vnto, it, than to the Word which aſſumed and tooke it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fiftly, <hi>Jf the fleſh, becauſe it is ſaide to bee quickning, is alſo omnipotent, and doth by proper vertue regenerate mens hartes: after the ſame ſort alſo may it bee ſaide, that the God-head alſo, becauſe it is redemptreſſe, is ſubiect to ſuffering and did ſuffer.</hi> For both quickning and redeeming, are properties of the office, common to both natures, but not after one and the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, <hi>The whole maieſty of the God-head is, that it is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, exiſting, not of another, but of it ſelfe, and ſubſiſting by it ſelfe, ſpirituall or incorporeal, eternall, immenſe, vnchaungeable, of infinite power, wiſedom, goodnes &amp;c.</hi> That is, the whole Maieſty compriſeth all the perfections and operations proper vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Godhead. <hi>But omnipotencie is the whole maieſtie of the God-head,</hi> according to the ſuppoſition of the <hi>Vbiquetaries:</hi> For ſo <hi>Schmideline</hi> writeth in the 142. concluſion of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, of the Lords Supper, &amp; of the communicating of the properties, had at <hi>Tubinge</hi> in the yeare <hi>M.D.LXXXII. In the word omnipotencie I compriſe the whole maieſtie of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:</hi> And in his 143. concluſion, <hi>Omnipotencie is the verie eſſence it ſelfe of the God-head. &amp;c.</hi> Therefore <hi>if Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie bee really communicated to Christs humanitie, ſo that this alſo is by reaſon of the omnipotency communicated vnto it, reallie omnipotent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of neceſſity then by reaſon of the ſame omnipotency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally communicated Chriſtes humanitie ſhall bee indeed an eſſence, ſubſiſting of it ſelfe and by it ſelfe, incorporeall, eternall, immenſe, creatres of all thinges,</hi> that is, God himſelfe bleſſed for euer, and ſo by conſequent, the diuine perſon. For an eſſence intelligent, ſubſiſting by it ſelfe, &amp; which alſo is God, muſt needs be the perſon. And theſe are the fruits of reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of properties in natures.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The participation of the God-head, exaltation and maieſtie of the fleſh and ſuch like, is not a real communicating of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall properties of the God-heade made into the humane nature,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:19538:283"/>
or an omnipreſence, omniſcience, omnipotency, that is, a God-head of the man-hood:</hi> For ſuch a communicating ſhould not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but deſtroy the man-hoode, and conuert it into the God-head, and diſſolue the perſonal vnion of diſtinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>but it is,</hi> Firſt, <hi>the verie vnion of the humanitie with the Word in ſuch ſort, as it being created &amp; finite, doth together with al the eſſential properties therof ſubſiſt, not in a created perſon of the ſame humane nature, but in the increate and eternal perſon of God the Word:</hi> by reaſon of which vnion, <hi>God the Word</hi> (but not the God-head) <hi>is &amp; is called trulie man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>No dignitie &amp; eminence can be imagined greater than this, neither doth it agree to anie but to the fleſh of Chriſt onely.

                        <p>Now whatſoeuer teſtimonies ſome bring either out of the Scriptures, or out of the Fathers which were ſound in faith, thereby to proue that their <hi>Eutychian tranſmutation,</hi> and a third kind of communicating forged by themſelues, that is, exequation or equalling of natures, all thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies indeed belong either <hi>to the grace of vnion</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is ſignified by <hi>the communicating of properties;</hi> or <hi>to the grace of Chriſtes Headſhip,</hi> which compriſeth the office and honour of the Mediatour, which are affirmed of whole Chriſt by waie of communicating: or <hi>to the habituall grace,</hi> that is, the created giftes, which Chriſt receiued without meaſure, which are properly affirmed of the fleſh or huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. <hi>Theſe giftes</hi> which are alſo called <hi>graces, are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie effectes of the perſonal vnion,</hi> as are the attributes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the natures and office. Firſt, <hi>becauſe they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the manhoode as well of the Father and the Holie Ghoſt, as of the Word or Sonne.</hi> For he is ſaid <hi>to haue receiued of
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:19538:284"/>
the Father the ſpirite without meaſure,</hi> that is, aboundauntlie: likewiſe <hi>to be annointed with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And, if the giftes were effects of the vnion, it would follow of neceſſity, that the fleſh was vnited not to the Son only, but to the Father alſo and the holy Ghoſt. Secondlie, <hi>The vnion of the fleſh with the Woord, was from the verie moment of the conception al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moſt perfect: But the conſummation and perfection of giftes was not vntil the accompliſhed time of his reſurrection &amp; aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For hee was indeede <hi>humble, weake, and contemned:</hi> he was indeede <hi>ignorant of ſome things:</hi> he did indeede <hi>encreaſe in wiſedome, ſtature, and in fauour not with men onely, but alſo with God himſelfe.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The fleſh, when it was in the ſtate of humility, had not immortality or a nature not ſubiect to ſufferings or the like, and yet remained it alwaies vnited with the Woorde.</hi> Wherefore the habitual giftes or graces of the humanitie, for which it is alſo in it ſelfe reallie wiſe, mighty, iuſt, holie, follow not the perſonal vnion in reſpect of dependency, as the effect followeth and dependeth of this cauſe, but onely in reſpect of order: Becauſe namely, the humane nature was firſt to ſubſiſt and bee, before it were enriched with giftes: and it ſubſiſteth vnited to the <hi>Woord</hi> in the very firſt moment of the conception.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>after what maner the humanitie is vnited vnto the Sonne of God,</hi> hath beene ſaid before.

becauſe it is in heauen, it is not verily in the earth: and in ſo much it is not, as that as touching it wee looke for Chriſt to come from heauen, whom as touching the Word we beleeue to bee in the earth with vs. Wherefore according to your opinion, either the Word is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in place with the fleſh, or the fleſh is euery where with the Word, where as one nature doth not receiue any contrarie or diuers thing in it ſelfe, and it is a thing diuerſe and far vnlike, to be circumſcribed in place, and to be euerie where: and ſeeing the Word is euerie where, and the fleſh is not euerie where; it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that one and the ſame Chriſt is of both natures, and is euerie where as touching the nature of his Godhead, but is not euerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where as touching the nature of his manhood: is created, and hath no beginning: is ſubiect to death, and cannot die: the one he hath by the nature of the Word, whereby hee is god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other by the nature of his fleſh, whereby the ſame God is man.

For others, as <hi>Stephen, Laurence,</hi> and
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:19538:286"/>
the like, ſuſteined only corporall paines and torments: but were vpheld within by the holy ghoſt. But Chriſt ſuffered the paines both of body &amp; ſoule. For <hi>he ſuffered firſt our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> that is, the infirmities of humane nature: <hi>he hungered, thirſted, was wearie, was stroken with ſadneſſe and griefe.</hi> 2 <hi>Hee ſuffered pouertie.</hi> Luk 9.58. <hi>The ſonne of man hath not whereon to lay his head.</hi> 3 <hi>He ſuffered infinite iniuries, contumelies, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, layings in wait for him, backbitings, reproches, blaſphemies, annihilating, and contempt.</hi> Pſalm. 22.7. <hi>I am a worme, and not a man.</hi> Iſay. 53.2. <hi>He hath neither forme nor beutie: when wee ſhall ſee him, there ſhall bee no forme that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> 4 <hi>Hee ſuffered the Tentations of the diuel,</hi> Mat. 4.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> He. 4.15. <hi>He was in all thinges tempted in like ſort.</hi> 5 <hi>Hee ſuffered the death of the bodie, and that reprochefull and contumelious, euen the death of the Croſſe.</hi> 6 <hi>He ſuffered the moſt grieuous torments of ſoule, that is, he found the ſenſe and feeling of the wrath of God againſt ſinne to be laide on him.</hi> Hereof it was that he cried with a loude voice, <hi>My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> as if he ſhould ſaie, why dooſt thou not driue and put away from me ſo great torments? For he ſignifieth by thoſe words not a diuulſion or ſeparation of his Godhead from his manhood, but the differring and delaying of help and ſuccour. We ſee then what and howe great thinges Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs, which are therefore propoſed vnto vs and ſette before our eyes, to giue vs to conſider 1. <hi>The hiſtory it ſelfe of Chriſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion agreeing with Gods ſacred oracles, and prophecies.</hi> 2. <hi>The cauſe or fruites of Chriſtes Paſſion.</hi> 3. <hi>His example, that wee are alſo to enter into eternal life, and heauenlie glorie, by death, as did Chriſt:</hi> and theſe three thinges are eſpecially to be conſidered in Chriſts Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Obiection <hi>There is no proportion betweene temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eternal. Chriſt ſuffered only temporal paines and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Therefore he could not ſatisfie gods iuſtice.</hi> Aunſwere. There is no proportion betweene temporall, and eternall puniſhment, if they bee conſidered as beeing both in the ſame degree and in the ſame ſubiect. Queſtion. <hi>But how may the raunſome of one perſon anſwere for the ſins of an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men?</hi> Aunſwere. It may, and that for theſe two cauſes. 1. Becauſe he is true God which ſuffered. Obiection. <hi>But god cannot die and ſuffer.</hi> Aunſwere. God cannot ſuffer, in that
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:19538:287"/>
he is God; Or further, we graunt, that Chriſt was not God, in that he ſuffered, &amp; died. Obiect. <hi>Chriſt is not God in that he ſuffered, Therefore it is falſe which is ſaide,</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>That God hath purchaſed the Church with his owne bloode.</hi> Anſ. This was ſpoken by a communicating of the properties, but this was in the perſon, not in the nature: that is, That perſon which is God and man, purchaſed the Church. <hi>The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of properties</hi> is, to attribute that to the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is proper vnto one nature; and this is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a concrete voice, not in an abſtract: becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete voice ſignifieth the perſon, in which are both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the property of that nature, whereof ſome thing is affirmed. But the abſtract name ſignifieth the nature which is in the perſon, but not the perſon. And therefore it is, that nothing hindereth, why that which is proper to one nature, may not bee affirmed of the whole perſon, ſo that propertie it ſelfe be in the perſon. But contrarie, of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract name onely the properties of that nature are affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, vnto which they properly belong. As of the God-heade, (which is the abſtract name) no propertie of the man-hoode maie be affirmed, but onelie the properties of the God-heade; becauſe the God-heade ſignifieth not the perſon which hath both natures, but onelie the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe. But of God (which is the concrete name) the properties not of the God-head only, but of the manhood alſo may be affirmed, becauſe God ſignifieth not the diuine nature, but the perſon which hath both the diuine nature, and humane.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe, why the raunſome of one perſon may aunſwere for the ſinnes of an infinite number, is <hi>the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of his puniſhment, becauſe hee ſuffered that which wee ſhould haue ſuffered for euer.</hi> His Paſſion therefore is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent to euerlaſting puniſhment; yea it ſurpaſſeth it; For, that God ſhould ſuffer, is more, than, that all the creatures ſhoulde periſh euerlaſtinglie.</p>

                  <p>CHRIST ſuffered not according to both natures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to his God-head, but according to his humane nature onely, both in body and ſoule. For his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature is immortal. Now he ſo ſuffered according to
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:19538:287"/>
his humanity, that by his death and Paſſion he made ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for infinite ſinnes of men.</p>
                  <p>Queſtion. <hi>But why could not his God-head ſuffer?</hi> Anſwere. Becauſe it is not changeable: neither can that, which is life it ſelfe, dy. This ſuſteined &amp; vpheld the humane nature in paines, &amp; after death reſtored it to life. Obiection. <hi>God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Church with his owne bloode.</hi> Actes 20.28. <hi>Therefore the god-head ſuffered.</hi> Aunſwere. It doth not follow, becauſe an argument from the concrete (which is, God) to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract (which is, the God-heade) is if no conſequence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the kind of affirmation is altered. <hi>God is ſaid to haue died, by a figure of ſpeech, which is Synecdoche</hi> (vſed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the whole by a part, as whole Chriſt, by, God,) <hi>and by a communicating of the properties.</hi> But when it is ſaid, <hi>The god-head died,</hi> that admitteth no figure, as beeing a meere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract. The concrete ſignifieth the ſubiect or perſon hauing the nature or forme: But the abſtract ſignifieth the bare nature and forme onelie. Wherefore the argument doth not follow. A man is compounded of the elementes, and is corporeal: Therefore his ſoul alſo is corporeal. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow; Becauſe al things agree not to the forme, which agree to the ſubiect; the ſoule is the forme of man, man is the eſſentiall ſubiect of the ſoule. Wherefore neither doth it follow. Chriſt, God, died: Therefore Chriſts God-heade died. For, from the concrete to the abſtract the reaſon doth not follow.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt therefore ſuffered according to his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onelie, making a ſufficicnt and moſt perfect ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby for our ſins. Which his ſatisfaction is made ours by applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is double. <hi>The one from god, who iuſtifieth vs for chriſts merit, &amp; maketh vs to ceaſe from ſin. The other from our ſelues who by faith apprehend &amp; applie vnto vs Chriſts merit by being fully perſuaded that God for the ranſome of his Son doth pardon vs our ſinne.</hi> Nowe that there was another nature in chriſt, which nether ſuffered nor died, is proued by theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Deſtroie this Temple, &amp; in three daies I wil raiſe it vp again.</hi> 1.

For no creature coulde haue ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a puniſhment, as ſhould haue beene equiualent to eternall puniſhment, and yet withall ſhould haue beene temporal.

Truely he died ſpirituallie eternal death, and now was dead: <hi>I hard</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>thy voice.</hi> There was a terrour in him, and a feeling of Gods wrath, a ſtrife with death, the loſſe of al the giftes both of body and mind. But there followed the equity, moderation, and lenitie of the Goſpell. For God had not expreſſely ſaide, that hee ſhoulde certainelie die wholy, and that preſently. For ſo had hee periſhed for euer. Wherefore the Sonne offered a mitigation and leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng, raiſed him vp to a new life, that ſtil notwithſtanding he ſhould remaine ſubiect to the corporal death, which yet ſhould not be deadlie and pernicious vnto him.</p>

One place enterpreteth another: for he had ſaid before vnto the Theefe: <hi>This daie ſhalt thou be with mee in Paradiſe,</hi> that is, in the place and ſtate of the bleſſed, where both are free from theſe paines; that is, hee ſpeaketh of felicity and liberty, which is not in Hell. Whereupon alſo it is clear, that Chriſt ſpake this to the Theefe, not of his God-head, but of that, which ſuffered, which was his ſoul. For the godhead was with the Theefe, neither did Chriſt ſuffer or was deliuered as touching his God-heade, but as touching his ſoule. Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt deſcended not into Hell locally as touching his bodie,</hi> becauſe his body was in the graue, neither roſe from any other place, but from the graue. It followeth therefore that this article cannot bee vnderſtood of a locall deſcenſion into Hell. Aunſwere 2 <hi>Albeit it were true that Chriſt deſcended locally into Hell: yet hee ſhoulde not haue deſcended for this cauſe which they imagine, as namely to deliuer the Fathers.</hi> Which alſo is prooued by this reaſon: <hi>If Chriſt deſcended locally into Hel, he deſcended either to ſuffer or to deliuer: Not to ſuffer;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now all thinges were finiſhed on the Croſſe: as chriſt himſelfe alſo hanging on the Croſſe ſaid, <hi>Jt is finiſhed. He deſcended not to deliuer the Fathers;</hi> 1 <hi>Becauſe he did this before, in ſuffering for them on earth.</hi> 2 <hi>Hee did the ſame by the power and efficacie of his God-heade, from the verie beginning of the worlde,</hi> not by the deſcenſion of his ſoule or bodie into Hel. 3 <hi>The Fathers were not in Limbo;</hi> Therefore they could not
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:19538:294"/>
be deliuered thence. As it is ſaide, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.46. <hi>Betweene you and vs there is a great gulfe ſet, ſo that they which would go from hence to you cannot; neither can they come from thence to vs.</hi> And in the ſame place, <hi>Lazarus</hi> is ſaid <hi>to bee in Abrahams boſome,</hi> not in Limbo. <hi>The ſoules of the iuſt are in the hand of God.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 Objection. <hi>Chriſt indeede did not deſcend into Hell, either to ſuffer or to deliuer, but (as ſome wil) to ſhewe the Diuell and Death his victorie, and ſo to strike a terrour into them. Which, they ſay, is confirmed by that place of Peter.</hi> 1. Pet. 3.19. <hi>By the which he alſo went &amp; preached vnto the ſpirits that are in priſon, which were in time paſſed diſobedient.</hi> Anſwere. That for this cauſe Chriſt deſcended into Hell, is not found in ſcripture: &amp; that place of Peter is thus to be vnderſtood, <hi>Chriſt went,</hi> that is, beeing ſent from the beginning of the Father vnto the Church, <hi>by his ſpirite,</hi> that is, by his God-head, <hi>and vnto the ſpirites that are now in priſon,</hi> that is, in Hell, <hi>hee preached in time paſſed, when as yet they liued &amp; were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> namely before the flud, and in the time of Noah, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiting them to repentance. So is alſo another ſaieng of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be vnderſtood, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Goſpel was alſo preached vnto the dead.</hi> That is, vnto thoſe which are now dead, or were then dead, when Peter wrote this, and who then liued when the Goſpel was preached vnto them. Reply. <hi>Chriſt deſcended into the loweſt partes of the earth,</hi> Epheſ. 4.9. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Hell.</hi> Aunſwere. Into the loweſt partes of the earth, that is, into the earth, which is the loweſt part of the world. This interpretation is prooued by the ſcope and drift of the Apoſtle, who maketh in that place an oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chriſts great glory, &amp; his great humiliation. But were it ſo, that theſe places, which ſome alleage for to eſtabliſh this opinion, were to be vnderſtood of a locall deſcenſion of Chriſt into Hell, yet would they not make for them, but rather for the papiſts, who teach, That chriſt preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers in Hell, and thence deliuered them. Now if theſe teſtimonies help not the Papiſts, muchleſſe wil they helpe them. For it <hi>is certaine, that it cannot be thence prooued that Chriſt deſcended into Hell to ſtrike a terrour into Death and the Diuell.</hi> This opinion indeed is not impious or vngodly, &amp; is approoued by manie of the Fathers: but yet I leaue it, becauſe it is not grounded on anie firme reaſons: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

                     <hi>CHRIST roſe, firſt by his owne power,</hi> euen by his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19. <hi>Destroie this temple, and in three daies I will raiſe it vp againe.</hi> Ioh. 10.18. <hi>I haue power to laie downe my ſoule, and haue power to take it vp againe.</hi> Ioh. 5.21. <hi>As the Father raiſeth vp the dead and quickeneth them, ſo the Sonne quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whom he will.</hi> Obiection. <hi>But the Father raiſed him,</hi> Rom. 4.24. <hi>Therefore hee raiſed not himſelfe.</hi> Aunſwere. The Father raiſed the Sonne by the Son himſelfe, not as by an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as by another perſon of the ſame eſſence and

power with the Father. The Sonne is raiſed of the Father by himſelfe: Himſelfe hath raiſed vp himſelfe by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Secondlie, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt true God and man roſe according to that nature according to which he ſuffered,</hi> namelie according to his humane nature, euen the true humane nature, and the ſame in eſſence and properties, and that not deified, but glorified, al infirmities thereof beeing done away. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. <hi>Behold my handes and my feete: for it is I my ſelfe: handle me, and ſee me: for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as yee ſee mee haue.</hi> And truely nothing elſe coulde riſe againe, but that which had fallen. The ſame bodie therefore which fell did riſe againe: which is the greateſt comfort vnto vs. For hee muſt haue been one and the ſame Mediatour, who ſhould merit for vs a communicating and participation of thoſe benefits, which we had loſt by ſin, &amp; who ſhould reſtore the ſame vnto vs, and applie them to euerie one. Againe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſtes fleſhe hadde riſen, neither ſhoulde ours riſe.

<pb n="574" facs="tcp:19538:296"/>
life and glorie eternall. For both belong vnto the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, who therefore obtaineth them for vs by his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and death, and in whom alſo the ſame benefites are therefore placed by the Godhead, that hee ſhould make vs partakers of them. Ioh. 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe haue al wee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi> Neither ought it to ſeeme any maruell, that Chriſt doth beſtow the ſame benefites on vs, which hee obtained of the Godhead by his death for vs. For a man may both obtaine a thing of one for another, and alſo beſtow the ſame on him for whom hee obtained it. As be it that one maketh requeſt for thee vnto the Prince for a gift of a thouſand crounes: the prince doth this for his ſake that requeſted it, and beſtoweth alſo that gift on him, that he may beſtow it on thee: hee then ſhall obtaine this gift for thee of the Prince, and withall ſhall beſtow the ſame on thee. Now albeit Chriſt could haue beſtowed the benefits of his death vpon vs by his Godhead, by the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee are iuſtified and regenerated, and beginne faith, and new life by the holy Ghoſt: yet notwithſtanding, as God decreed, by man to raiſe the dead (for <hi>by man came the reſurrection.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.21.) and by man to iudge the worlde; ſo alſo hath hee decreed to beſtowe theſe giftes by Ieſus, man, that the ſame might be and continue mediatour, who is true God and man. Therefore alſo it was requiſite, that Chriſt ſhould remaine for euer our brother and our head; &amp; that we of the other ſide being engraffed into him by a true faith, ſhoulde alwaies remaine his members. Which thing al the teſtimonies doe confirme, which attribute an eternall kingdome vnto the ſeede of Dauid. For on that kingdome is our ſaluation grounded: and the kingdome of Chriſt the Sonne of Dauid could by no meanes haue been eternal, if his humane nature had continued in death. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. <hi>But in the old teſtament, before his incarnation, or humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, Chriſt without his humanitie, did beſtow the ſame benefits on the Fathers, which hee bestoweth on vs in the new Teſtament, and was no leſſe before the taking of fleſh Mediatour, than ſince: alſo he did the ſame thinges before his comming, which he dooth after his comming in the fleſh.</hi> Anſ. But neither had hee then doone thoſe thinges, except hee ſhould haue beene after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, and haue continued alwaies man: ſo neither
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:19538:296"/>
now ſhould he doe the ſame, if hee did not reteine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he tooke for euer. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.27. <hi>The father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſonne alſo power to execute iudgement, in that hee is the ſonne of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>He roſe for vs,</hi> and that in three reſpectes. 1. <hi>For our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>our Lord Ieſus chriſt was deliuered to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our iuſtification.</hi> Now <hi>the reſurrection of our Mediatour was requiſite, for our iuſtification,</hi> firſt becauſe, <hi>except his puniſhment had beene finite, wee coulde not haue recouered out of euerlaſting death, from which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour was ſo to deliuer vs,</hi> as that hee ſhoulde vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it in vs. If then our Mediatour was vtterlie to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and ouercome death in vs, hee ought then ſo to die, as to ouercome death firſt in himſelfe, and ſo to fulfill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede that which was foretolde. <hi>Oſe</hi> 13.14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. <hi>Death is ſwallowed vp into victorie. O Death, where is thy ſting? O graue, where is thy victorie?</hi> Againe, <hi>Except Chriſt had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death, he could not haue beſtowed his benefites on vs, which by his death hee had merited for vs;</hi> neither ſhould we knowe that hee had ſatisfied for vs; becauſe, if hee had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in death, it had beene a certaine argument that he had not ſatisfied, but was ouercome of death, &amp; of the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſin. For where death is, there is ſinne: or if he had ſatisfied, &amp; yet had remained in death, this had been contrarie to the iuſtice of God. Wherefore Chriſt was to riſe, both that wee might knowe, that hee had promerited benefites for vs, and alſo that himſelfe might applie the ſame vnto vs: that is, that by his merit and efficacy we might be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſaued and iuſtified. 2. <hi>Chriſt roſe for our regeneration.</hi> For iuſtification, or remiſſion of ſinnes ſufficeth not, without the inchoation and beginning of a new life. 3. <hi>For our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glorification.</hi> God wil by this meanes euerlaſtinglie quicken and glorifie vs, that beeing inſerted and engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into the maſſe of his Son, that is, his humane nature, wee maie for euer bee carried of it, and out of it drawe life. For theſe cauſes it was neceſſarie, that Chriſt ſhoulde riſe againe, that is, that his ſoul, which was laide downe from the body, ſhould be againe ioined with the ſame body. For reſurrection is nothing elſe, than a coniunction or reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſame body with the ſame ſoule.</p>

                  <p>ALL the cauſes of Chriſts Reſurrection are not fruites of his Reſurrection. And after a diuerſe maner are the cauſes, and the fruites of his reſurrection conſidered: and moreouer the benefites of Chriſt beſtowed by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, are one way conſidered as cauſes of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and otherwiſe as fruites of the ſame. For the Queſtions are diuerſe, <hi>Wherefore christ roſe:</hi> And, <hi>What fruits Chriſts reſurrection bringeth vnto vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Furdermore the fruite of Christs reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of two ſorts:</hi> the one <hi>reſpecting chriſt,</hi> the other, <hi>vs.</hi> For firſt (as the Apoſtle ſayth Rom. 1.4.) <hi>Hee is declared by the reſurrection to bee the Sonne of God:</hi> euen the onely begotten and beloued Sonne of God, who is alſo God himſelfe. Againe, Chriſts humane nature alſo was by his reſurrection adorned with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which becommeth the nature of the Son of God. <hi>The fruit of Chriſts reſurrection which reſpecteth vs,</hi> is of many ſorts. But, to ſpeake in general, <hi>all the benefites of chriſtes death are the fruites, which we receiue by his reſurrection:</hi> For Chriſtes reſurrection maketh, that his death hath his effect. Chriſt by his reſurrection dooth applie vnto vs thoſe benefites, which he merited for vs by his death, &amp; by this means the ſame are the <hi>benefits</hi> both of his death &amp; reſurrection, <hi>which are otherwiſe merited for vs, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ar beſtowed on vs.</hi> For <hi>it was not neceſſarie that the verie act of meriting &amp; deſeruing ſhould dure all the time both of the old and the new Church: but onely the act of beſtowing or applieng the ſame,</hi> and therefore it <hi>was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie alſo that the Mediatour ſhould be continually,</hi> that hee might beſtow thoſe benefites on the Church, which hee was once to merite, for this can not bee doone without a Mediatour, and therefore neither can the Church be for one moment without a Mediator. In the old church Chriſt the Mediator did beſtow on the Fathers the benefits of his death to come by the force and efficacy of his reſurrection to come: nowe he beſtoweth them on vs by the efficacie of his reſurrection alreadie paſt.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth now that wee <hi>in ſpeciall</hi> reckon the chiefe fruites, which the reſurrection of Chriſt bringeth vnto vs. Firſt then <hi>by the reſurrection of Chriſt wee know him to be the Meſſias, as in whom the prophecies were fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="577" facs="tcp:19538:297"/>Secondly, <hi>We are confirmed and warranted by Chriſtes reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> 1. <hi>Of his merit: That hee hath fullie and perfectlie ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for our ſinnes.</hi> For one onelie ſinne, not being ſatisfied for, had withheld chriſt ſtill in death. He was caſt into ſuch a priſon, as that, except he had paied the vtmoſt farthing, he had not beene let goe: But he was let goe and dimiſſed: Therefore he paied the vtmoſt farthing. 2. <hi>We are confirmed, of the application of Chriſtes benefites, which could not haue been beſtowed, if he had not riſen:</hi> For, as was ſaid before, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that the ſelfeſame Mediatour, beeing man, ſhould riſe againe. <hi>Ioh</hi> 7.39. <hi>The holy Ghoſt was not yet giuen, Ieſus was not yet glorified.</hi> Wherefore wel ſaith Saint Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>That Chriſt is riſen again for our righteouſnes,</hi> that is, to confer and apply righteouſneſſe vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>A fruit of chriſtes reſurrection is the gift of the holie Ghoſt, by whom chriſt regenerateth vs and giueth vs eternal life.</hi> Before time the Godlie were alſo endued with the holie Ghoſt, and regenerated, but more ſparingly than nowe in the newe Teſtament, and yet both by the force and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his reſurrection. For the holy Ghoſt, by whoſe vertue and operation onely wee are regenerated, cannot be giuen but by the reſurrection and aſcenſion of chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>We muſt alſo aſcribe and attribute it vnto chriſtes reſurrection, that hee preſerueth vs by his perpetuall and applied righteouſneſſe,</hi> that hee beginneth in vs eternal life, and ſo dooth alſo aſcertaine and aſſure vs of the conſummation and accompliſhment of eternall life, whereof wee cannot bee certaine except wee haue the beginning thereof: and the beginning we ſhould not haue, except we had the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Fiftlie, <hi>The reſurrection of our bodies is the fruite of chriſtes reſurrection,</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe chriſt is our Heade, and wee his members.</hi> Now it is expedient for the Heades glorifie, that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers bee glorious. Chriſt indeede ſhoulde bee by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, though hee had no members, or if his members con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in death: but hee ſhould not be Head: becauſe he is not heade but in reſpect of his members: Neither ſhoulde hee bee a king without a kingdome, according to the nature of correlatiues, whoſe verie beeing depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vppon neceſſarie relation which one hath to the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:19538:298"/>
other: and according to the nature of correlatiues a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous head doth require glorious members, and ſuch as are correſpondent vnto it. 2. <hi>Becauſe if Chriſt be riſen, he hath alſo aboliſhed ſinne: If he hath aboliſhed ſinne, either hee hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his own ſin, or ours: but not his owne, therefore ours. If he hath aboliſhed our ſin, he hath aboliſhed death alſo:</hi> For, if the cauſe be taken awaie, the effect likewiſe is taken awaie. <hi>The wages of ſinne is death.</hi> Further, if he hath aboliſhed death, and that by a ſufficient ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, which ſatisfaction hee hath ſhewed and declared by his reſurrection to bee ſufficient: it is certaine that his reſurrection is a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine teſtimonie of our reſurrection: for he hauing perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſufficient ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of his members, the members cannot remaine in death. But the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt the Heade is an argument of the perfect ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of his members. Therefore Chriſtes reſurrection is alſo an argument of the perfect reſurrection of his members. 3. <hi>As the firſt Adam receiued bleſſinge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for himſelfe, and all his poſteritie, and loſt the ſame from all: So Chriſt the ſecond Adam receiued life and al other giftes for himſelfe and others,</hi> and therefore alſo will communicate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life with vs. 4. <hi>Seeing the ſame ſpirite dwelleth in vs which did in Chriſt, hee ſhall woorke alſo the ſame in vs, which in our Head he did.</hi> For the ſpirit is alwaies like, neither dooth he woorke in the Head, and ſleepe in the members. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing Chriſt hath raiſed himſelfe vp by his ſpirite for the dead, he wil verilie alſo raiſe vs vp. For if hee raiſed himſelfe vp beeing dead, much more ſhal he bee able bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliue to raiſe vs vp. 5. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt is man: for execept hee were man, we ſhoulde haue no hope of the reſurretion of our fleſh. For by man came reſurrection.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.21. Obiection. 1. <hi>Then the wicked ſhall not riſe againe: becauſe chriſtes reſurrection is neither an argument, nor the cauſe of the reſurrection of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but of the godlie onelie.</hi> Aunſwere. There be other cauſes for which the wicked ſhal riſe again: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, whereby he hath appointed them to eternall paines. For the ſame thing maie haue moe effectes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe cauſes. Obiection. 2 <hi>Theſe are the benefites of his death: therefore not of his reſurrection.</hi> Aunſwere.

<pb n="579" facs="tcp:19538:298"/>
of the application of his benefites. Hee beeing rich was made poore, and beeing poore was made rich againe, that he might enrich vs. Obiection 3. <hi>The effect is not before the cauſe. The cauſe of theſe benefites which is his reſurrection, was not before the first reſurrection: therefore neither the effect, that is, the benefites themſelues.</hi> Aunſwere. The reſurrection was not, as touching the accompliſhment thereof, but in the counſell of God and in efficacie and vertue, it was in the olde Teſtament. For then alſo were men receiued into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, they were endued with the holie Ghoſt, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the other benefits: but for and by the Mediator which was in time appointed to be humbled and glorified.</p>
                  <p>The laſt, though not the leaſt fruite of chriſtes reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is, <hi>The conſummation and perfecting of all his benefites, and the glorifieng of his church.</hi> For chriſt did therefore die, and is therefore riſen, and hath therefore perfectlie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs from ſinne: that wee may bee ioint-heires with him of his kingdome. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Hee is the firſt borne of the dead.</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>Wee are the heires of God, and heires annexed with Chriſt. He ſhal conforme vs and make vs like vnto himſelfe, becauſe we liue by the ſame ſpirit, whereby he dooth.</hi> And this ſpirite is not vnlike himſelfe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Jf the ſpirite of him, that raiſed vp Ieſus from the dead, dwell in you: he that raiſed vp Christ from the deade, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that his ſpirit dwelleth in you.</hi> Ioh. 14.3. <hi>I wil come againe, and receiue you vnto my ſelfe, that where I am, there maie yee bee alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this we obſerue, That <hi>the whole humiliation of the Mediatour doth not dure for euer.</hi> For it was enough that hee ſuffered once: but the efficacie and power thereof in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing and maintaining the bleſſings thereby comming, endureth for euer. <hi>Chriſt therefore roſe,</hi> that is, by his owne proper vertue and power brought againe and returned his ſoule vnto his bodie, that both ſoule and bodie might bee deliuered from al ignominie and infirmitie; and be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with immortalitie and perfect glorie; That is, 1. <hi>Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his ſoule vnto his bodie.</hi> 2. <hi>But both yet beeing now glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and freed from infirmities.</hi> 3. <hi>By his owne proper power he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his ſoule.</hi> I beleeue then that Chriſt is raiſed from the dead, that is, that he therefore roſe againe from the dead,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:19538:299"/>
that hee might make vs partakers of his righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, glorification, which hee purchaſed for vs by his merite. Seeing therefore Chriſt is riſen, it is manifeſt that hee is declared to bee the Sonne of God, and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his humanitie, is endowed with that glory, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the nature of the Sonne of God: and further that he endueth vs alſo with his ſpirite, regenerateth vs by the vertue of his ſpirite, and wil at length conſummate and perfect the new life begun in vs, and make vs compartners of the ſame his glory, felicity, and euerlaſting life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CHriſt aſcended into Heauen, firſt, not ſimplie, but in reſpect of his humane nature onely,</hi> &amp; that the very ſame, <hi>which was borne of the virgin, dead, buried, and which roſe againe.</hi> Obiect. 1 <hi>He that euer is in heauen, did not aſcend into heauen, for then he ſhould haue beene ſome time out of heauen. But the Sonne of man euer was in heauen; Therefore he did not aſcend.</hi> Aunſ. Hee that euer was in heauen, as touching that whereby he was euer there, that is, his Diuinity, did not aſcend; and ſo we grant Chriſt according to his Diuinity not to haue aſcended: for that was before in Heauen: &amp; as when Chriſt was on earth, the ſame did not therefore leaue heauen: So when hee is now in Heauen, his Diuinitie doth not therefore depart from vs. Obiection. 2 <hi>That which deſcended, did alſo aſcend. His Diuinity did deſcend. Therefore it did alſo aſcend.</hi> Aunſwere. The ſignification of deſcending is not here proper. His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie is ſaid to haue deſcended, that is, to haue opened &amp; manifeſted it ſelfe in a place where before it had not. 2 <hi>He aſcended locally or bodily,</hi> that is, truly going from one place to another. He tranſlated his human nature fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a lower place, by a reall &amp; moſt proper tranſlation or remoouing: which could not haue bin don, if he had bin in body euery where. 3 <hi>He tooke or lifted vp his humane nature into heauen, and by his proper power and vertue entered into the poſſeſsion of heauenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Obiect. 3. <hi>That which is not in any place is euerie-where. Christ is not in any place, becauſe he is aſcended aboue and beyond the viſible heauen, beyond which there is not any place: Therefore Chriſt is euerie where.</hi> Anſ. Firſt we deny, <hi>the ſame to bee euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which is not in any p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> not in any place, neither yet is it euery-where. But this is ſpoken of a natural place, which is defined to be the ſuperficiall extremitie of a bodie, compaſſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining ſo any thing within it, as it ſelfe alſo is compaſſed &amp; conteined within another. Secondly, then we ſay, <hi>that Chriſt is not in any naturall place, but in a place ſupernaturall,</hi> which doth contein, but is not it ſelfe conteined: and ſuch a ſupernaturall place is beyond the viſible heauen: but what manner a thing that ſupernaturall place is, is not learned by the diſcourſe of mans wit and reaſon, but only by a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall viewe and beholding, which the Angels enioy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:19538:300"/>
But that <hi>Chriſt did aſcend locally,</hi> theſe places of the Scripture conuince, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Ye ſhal not haue me alwaies.</hi> Ioh. 16.7. <hi>If J go not away, the comforter will not come vnto you.</hi> Ioh. 6.62. <hi>What then, if ye ſhould ſee the Sonne of man aſcend vp, where he was before?</hi> Act. 1.9. <hi>While they beheld he was taken vp.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>He was taken vp into heauen.</hi> Coloſſ. 3.1. <hi>Seeke thoſe thinges which are aboue, where Christ ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Of theſe it followeth, that Chriſts humane nature is finite, and doth change place, and therefore is not euerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. For to be euery where, and to change place, are contradictorie. And therefore alſo his God-head, which alone is infinite, eternall, and euerie-where, is not ſaid to chaunge place. But here the <hi>Vbiquetaries</hi> ſeeke a ſhift, that they may not be hurt by this weapon; <hi>That which changeth place is not euerie-where; Chriſts body changeth place. Therefore that is not euery-where.</hi> They grant the Maior of this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme to be true taking the wordes after one manner: but here they contend that the words are taken after a diuerſe manner: As <hi>that Chriſts bodie is euery-where, that is, after the manner of maieſtie, or in manner as it is a maieſticall bodie; it changeth place, in manner of a naturall bodie, or as it is a naturall bodie.</hi> But they eſcape not a contradiction by this cauil. For the diuerſe maner which taketh away a contradiction muſt not fall into the ſame and be all one with the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for the clearing of which they are brought. For ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it made a meere <hi>tautologie,</hi> or ſpeaking of the ſame thing, &amp; a begging of that which is in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if I imitating them ſhould ſay, <hi>This aire is light, according to the manner of light, and it is darcke, as touching the manner of darckneſſe:</hi> Againe, <hi>This man is poore as touching the manner of pouertie, and is rich as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner of riches.</hi> Thus is the ſame affirmed of the ſame. For the manner of pouerty is nothing elſe but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and the manner of riches nothing but riches. So likewiſe theſe manners which they faign and imagin in the Maior propoſition are altogether the ſame with the things which are affirmed. That is, the ſame in them is affirmed of the ſame, &amp; ſo theſe maners are that in which lyeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For they ſay, <hi>Chriſts bodie is euerie where, according to the maner of maieſtie,</hi> Beeing demaunded what they mean by <hi>maieſtie,</hi> they aunſwere, <hi>omnipotencie,</hi> and <hi>immenſitie.</hi> To
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:19538:301"/>
ſaie then, <hi>Chriſtes bodie is euerie where as touching the manner of maieſtie, not as touching the manner of a natural bodie,</hi> is no thing elſe, euen by their owne iudgement, than, Chriſtes bodie to bee euerie where according to the manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitie, or infinity, and not to bee euerie where according to the manner of finiteneſſe. Now they trimlie take awaie the contradiction by thus diſtinguiſhing. For the manner of immenſitie, is nothing elſe but immenſitie: and immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and to bee immenſe, are both affirmed of the ſame. Wherefore as theſe are contradictorie, to be euerie where, &amp; to change place, or, not to bee euerie where; ſo are theſe alſo contradictorie: <hi>The ſame bodie to bee immenſe and to bee finite, immenſitie and finiteneſſe to agree vnto the ſame;</hi> or, <hi>the ſame bodie to be euerie where, or immenſe according to the maner of immenſity or maieſtie, and not to be euerie where but to change place, and to bee finite according to the manner of finiteneſſe or a natural bodie.</hi> Wherfore it is manifeſt, which was before alſo confirmed, That <hi>Chriſt aſcended locallie,</hi> and that therefore this Article is to be vnderſtoode <hi>of Chriſts local aſcenſion.</hi>

Hee is with vs in that ſpirituall vnion whereby we his members are ioined to him our head. And further he ſpeaketh of his whole perſon, to which hee attributeth that which is proper vnto the God-head. In like manner he ſaith before his paſſion, when as yet hee conuerſed on earth with his Diſciples, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.23. <hi>J and my Father will come vnto him, and will dwell with him:</hi> this hee ſpeaketh as touching his God-head, which was and is in heauen, &amp; as the Father is with vs, ſo is hee: otherwiſe wee might reaſon alſo thus, <hi>J go awaie,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: Therefore he is not at all with vs. But it is attributed improperly to his other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, namely to his humanitie, that he abideth with vs, in reſpect of that perſonall vnion, which is the ſecret &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful indiſſoluble vniting and knitting of the two moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe natures of Chriſt, diuine &amp; humane, into one perſon,

ſo that theſe two natures, being in ſuch wiſe linked &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined, abſolue the eſſence of Chriſts perſon, and one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be deſtroied, if it were ſundered from the other; both notwithſtanding reteining their peculiar and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall properties, whereby one is diſtinguiſhed from another.

In chriſt are two natures, whereof one, which is his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, is not where is the other, which is his godhead. Therefore the two natures in christ are not vnited but ſeparated.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is true being vnderſtood of two finite natures, but not of thoſe whereof one is finite, and another infinite For the finite nature can not be at once in moe places: but the infinite nature may be at once both whole in the finite nature, and whole without it: and this may we indeede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and obſerue in chriſt. For his humane nature which is finite, is but in one place; but his diuine nature, which is infinite, is both in chriſts humane nature, and without it, &amp; euen euerie where.

                  <p>THE chiefe fruites of chriſtes aſcenſion are: Firſt, <hi>His Interceſſion,</hi> which ſignifieth, 1. <hi>The perpetual vertue and ſtrength of chriſtes Sacrifice.</hi> 2. <hi>Both wils in chriſt, both humane and diuine, propitious and fauourable vnto vs,</hi> whereby he will that for his Sacrifice we be receiued of his Father. 3. <hi>The Aſſent of his Father approuing this his Sonnes will, and accepting of the value of his ſacrifice as a ranſome for our ſins:</hi> and as the Father receiueth vs, ſo doth he alſo. Obiection. <hi>But before chriſtes aſcenſion, yea before his comming, there was interceſſion.</hi> Anſw. That depended of this, that is, it was made in reſpect of this interceſſion to come, as alſo the whole receiuing into fauour from the beginning of the woorlde. For hee, our Mediatour, made interceſſion before with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he accompliſhing his ſacrifice ſhould appeare for euer in the heauenly Sanctuarie. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.57. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for euer according to the order of Melchiſedech.</hi> And further, that interceſſion in the olde Teſtament was not ſuch, as it is now in Heauen. For nowe hee wil haue vs receiued for his ranſome already paied, which then was afterwards to be paied.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond fruite is, <hi>our glorification or aſcenſion:</hi> For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt our head is aſcended, we are certaine that wee alſo ſhal aſcend into heauen, as beeing his members. <hi>Iohn</hi>

Therefore chriſt is not by his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the cauſe of our aſcenſion.</hi> Aunſwere. They aſcended in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſtes aſcenſion, which was to come. Chriſtes aſcenſion and glorification is the cauſe and example of our aſcenſion and glorification, becauſe except he were glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, wee ſhould not bee glorified. For the Father hath decreed to giue vs all thinges by the Meſſias, and hath put all thinges in his hands. And how ſhould Chriſt haue giuen vs a kingdome, except himſelfe firſt, as beeing the firſt borne, had taken poſſeſſion thereof? But for this cauſe alſo he aſcended into heauen, that hee might there raign. Therefore hee wil tranſlate his citizens thither. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are his members, and he, our head, is already aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and glorified: Therefore ſhall wee alſo aſcend, and bee glorified. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.26. <hi>Where J am, there ſhall alſo my ſeruaunt bee.</hi> And Iohn 14.3. <hi>J wil receiue you vnto my ſelfe, that where J am, there maie yee be alſo.</hi>

                  <p>Many Obiections are by this definition refuted, As 1. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt alſo is equal with God: Therefore wee may truely ſay, that hee alſo ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Aunſwere.

For although the Holy Ghoſt bee as well as the Father and the ſonne, Head and Lord and ruler of the Church, yet doth it not agree to the Holy Ghoſt, but <hi>to chriſt alone, to ſit at the right hand of the Father:</hi> Becauſe hee alone tooke humane nature, was humbled, dead, buried, roſe againe, aſcended, and is Mediatour. And furder the Father woorketh immediately by the Sonne onely: but by the holy Ghoſt the Father doth not worke immediatly, but through the ſonne. For the ſame order is to be kept in their operation and working which is in the perſons. The Father worketh by him ſelfe, but of himſelfe, becauſe he is of none: The Sonne worketh by himſelfe, not of himſelfe, becauſe he is begotten of the Father: The holy ghoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by himſelfe, but from the Father and the Sonne, from whom he dooth proceed. Therefore the father woorketh immediately by the Sonne: becauſe the Sonne is before the holy ghoſt, yet not in time but in order: but mediately the Father woorketh by the holy Ghoſt: and therefore <hi>the Sonne is rightly ſaide to ſitte at the right hand of the Father, but not the holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2.

Therefore he cannot now be firſt, after his aſcenſion, ſaid to ſitte at gods right hand.</hi> Aunſwere. Againe, this reaſon alſo is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bad definition. Chriſt was alwaies glorious; but hee
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:19538:306"/>
was not alwaies aduaunced and exalted in the office of his Mediatorſhippe, to wit, in his kingdome and prieſthood.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt is called our Head,</hi> 1 <hi>In reſpect of his perfection &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, both as God and man.</hi> And as concerning his godhead, there is no doubt of it.

Therefore thus Chriſt alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his diuine nature was placed at his Fathers right hand, namelie by laieng downe that humility, which he tooke on him for our ſake, and by ſhewing foorth that <hi>glorie, which hee had with his Father before the foundations of the woorlde were laide</hi> (but had hid the ſame in the time of his humiliation) not by adding any thing vnto it, which it had not before, neither by making it more bright &amp; power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, neither by manifeſting and declaring it before God, but vnto men, and by vſing fully and freely his right and authoritie, which right and authoritie Chriſtes diuinitie had as it were laid downe in the taking vp and aſſumption of humane nature. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.5. <hi>Now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mee thou Father with thy owne ſelfe, with the glorie, which J had with thee before the world was.</hi> This glorie he had not with men.

This reaſon wee graunt in reſpect of the communicating of the properties to the perſon. But if it be further concluded, that according to the fleſh he is euerie where, there wil be more in the concluſion, than was in the premiſſes. Againe, wee denie the conſequence of the whole reaſon: becauſe, <hi>the right hand of God,</hi> and <hi>to ſit at the right hande of God,</hi> is not all one.

                  <p>Obiection. <hi>Hee aſcended into heauen, to fill al thinges, that is, with the preſence of his fleſh.</hi> Aunſwere. It is a fallacy in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtring the word. <hi>He aſcended to fill all thinges,</hi> that is, with his giftes and graces, not with his fleſh, bones and skinne.

That nature which hath receiued omnipotency by a reall transfuſion and communication of the properties, is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where, but not that which hath receiued it by perſonall vnion onely, as the humane nature of Chriſt.

But the whole certainty thereof is grounded on diuine Prophecies, or of the doctrine of the church. For although the Philoſopher perhaps woulde ſay ſomewhat, as ſeeing a
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:19538:309"/>
litle through a miſt: as, <hi>That it is not likely that man was born to this miſerie:</hi> yet by reaſon that man hath loſt the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the righteouſneſſe, goodneſſe, &amp; truth of God, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not know out of philoſophy, that any iudgement ſhal be: muchleſſe with what circumſtances it ſhall be. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Philoſophy yeeldeth, are forcible indeed in themſelues, but are not made knowen but in diuinity: and therefore the argumentes themſelues are onely made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible &amp; of ſtrength in diuinity. Wherefore we wil draw rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons &amp; proofs out of diuinity or the doctrine of the goſpel, by which it may appear that there is a laſt iudgement.</p>
                  <p>The firſt proof is drawn <hi>from expreſſe &amp; plaine teſtimonies of ſacred Scripture:</hi> As out of the prophecy of Dan. Likewiſe out of the prophecy of Enoch, alleadged by the Apoſtle <hi>Iude, verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>Behold the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth with thouſands of his ſaints, To giue iudgement againſt all men.</hi> Moreouer, out of the ſermons of Chriſt, eſpeciallie in Mat. 24. verſ. 25.

Acts. 17.31. <hi>He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a daie in the which he wil iudge the world in righteouſnes by that man whom he hath appointed.</hi> 1. Theſ. 4.16. <hi>The lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhal deſcend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen with a ſhout, &amp; with the voice of the Archangel, &amp; with the trumpet of god.</hi> Neither is the certainty of the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t only by theſe &amp; the like plain teſtimonies of Scripture, but is deduced alſo out of other places by good conſequence: &amp; hence are made thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which the Philoſophers ſaw but by a glims.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond proofe is drawen <hi>from the ende whereunto mankind was created.</hi> God neceſſarily obtaineth his end; but to this end did he create mankind, that man ſhoulde bee the image of God, and the euerlaſting temple of God, wherein he ſhould be worſhipped; to whom he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelfe, perfect wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and goodneſſe, and would impart his bleſſedneſſe. This bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe is a part of Gods Image: but this the Diuell hath deſtroied: Therefore God ſhall reſtore it, who is mightier than the Diuell. And although the end, for which man was created, is hindered diuerſe waies in this life: yet god will at ſome time obtaine it. Wherefore <hi>it is not onlie</hi> (as the Philoſophers reaſon) <hi>likelie and probable, that man was not made for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this argument is confirmed alſo the happineſſe of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: According to that of Saint Paul, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Know you not that your bodie is the temple of the holy ghoſt which is in you?</hi>

Therefore alſo ſhall the godly ſay: <hi>When ſaw wee thee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering or thirſting?</hi> They ſhall confeſſe that the retribution of rewardes commeth not by their merit, but by his grace.

                  <p>FIrſt therefore, <hi>that the holy ghoſt is a perſon;</hi> is prooued, 1 <hi>By his apparitions.</hi> Becauſe he hath appeared viſible. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The holy ghoſt came downe in a bodilie ſhape like a Doue.</hi> Act. 2.3. <hi>And there appeared vnto them clouen toungs like fire, and it (that is, the fire, or the holie ghoſt) ſate vpon each of them.</hi> Seeing then the holy Ghoſt deſcended in bodilie ſhape vpon Chriſt, and ſate vpon the Apoſtles, it followeth that he is <hi>ſubſiſting.</hi> For no qualitie or created motion of minds or hearts is able to doe in like manner. For an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doth not only not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it any ſhape but ſtandeth in neede of ſome thing elſe in which it ſelfe ſhould conſiſt and bee. Neither is the aire the place or ſubiect of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, godlineſſe, loue of God, and other ſpiritual motions, but the mindes of men. 2. He is proued <hi>to be a perſon, becauſe he is called god.</hi> 1. Cor. 3.16. <hi>Know yee not that yee are the temple of god, and that the ſpirite of god dwelleth in you?</hi> Acts 5.3. <hi>Why hath ſatan filled thine hart, that thou ſhouldeſt lie vnto the holie Ghoſt?</hi> And in the next verſe, he ſaith; <hi>Thou haſt not lied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, but vnto god.</hi> See alſo <hi>Iſai</hi> 40.7.13. <hi>Actes</hi> 28.25. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4.30. Howeſoeuer then the aduerſaries of this doctrine gtaunt the holy Ghoſt to be God, yet this cannot bee, but he muſt be a ſubſiſtent or perſon, ſeing God is a being; but our godlineſſe, goodneſſe, Godly motions, and other diuine affections cannot be called God. 3. <hi>He is a perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the author of our Baptiſme, and we are baptized in his name,</hi> that is, by his commaundement and wil. But wee are not baptized by the commaundement and wil of a deade thing, or of a thing not exiſting, neither are wee baptized in the name of the graces or giftes of God. 4. <hi>Becauſe the properties of a perſon are attributed vnto him, as that hee teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he diſtributeth giftes euen as he wil, that he comforteth, confirmeth, ruleth, raigneth; likewiſe, that hee ſendeth Apoſtles, that hee ſpeaketh in the Apostles.</hi> Luke 12.12. <hi>The holie Ghoſt
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:19538:315"/>
ſhall teach you in the ſame houre what yee ought to ſaie.</hi> So alſo he declareth the thinges to come. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>The ſpirite of truth wil ſhewe you the thinges to come. Hee giueth prophecies: he commaundeth and willeth that the Apoſtles be ſeparated; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he appointeth teachers in the church.</hi> All theſe are thinges proper vnto a perſon, exiſting, intelligent, endued with a wil, working, and liuing. 5. <hi>Becauſe hee is plainlie diſtinguiſhed from the giftes and graces of God.</hi> 1. Corinth. 12.11. <hi>All theſe things worketh the ſelfeſame ſpirite, diſtributing to euery man ſeuerallie as he wil:</hi> And againe. 1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 12.4. <hi>There are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of giftes, but the ſame ſpirit.</hi> Wherefore the giftes differ much from the ſpirite it ſelfe. Obiection. <hi>The gift of God is not a perſon. The holie Ghoſt is called the gift of God,</hi> Actes. 2.38. <hi>Therefore he is not a perſon.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is falſe. For the ſonne beeing giuen, is the gift of God, and yet is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The holie Ghoſt is called <hi>the gift of god,</hi> becauſe hee is ſent from the Father and the ſonne. <hi>John</hi> 15.26. <hi>J will ſend the comforter vnto you from the Father.</hi> Or we maie aunſwere: Hee is called a gift in reſpect that hee was ſent and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the hearts of the ſaintes, to whom hee is giuen, and is ſuch a gift as woorketh by his vertue and power the reſt of the giftes and graces. Now, that, <hi>to proceede,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>to exiſt or be from both,</hi> I prooue: <hi>Becauſe Paul calleth him the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of god, which is of god, and in god. Of god;</hi> Becauſe the ſpirit floweth from the Father and the Sonne; In God: therefore he is ſomewhat of God himſelfe. Other ſpirites are not in God, that is, in the ſubſtaunce of God. And what is in God, that is the very eſſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the holy ghoſt is other,</hi> that is, diſtinct from the Father and the Sonne, wee prooue againſt thoſe, who ſay hee is the ſubſiſtent of the Father. Which wee prooue, 1. <hi>From his verie appellation,</hi> in that hee is called the ſpirite. For none is his owne ſpirite: As none is his owne Father; and none his owne Sonne: Therefore hee is other from both. Obiection. <hi>That which is common to al the perſons, ought not to be diſtinguiſhed and ſeuered. The name ſpirite is common to all three perſons: Therefore it ought not to bee diſtinguiſhed.</hi> Aunſwere. This whole reaſon wee graunt. If it bee vnderſtoode of the eſſence of the perſons, and not of their order of beeing and woorcking. For as hee that
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:19538:316"/>
breatheth, and the breath it ſelfe differ; ſo hee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth, and the ſpirite are different: Hee that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth is one, and hee another, from whom hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The thirde perſon of the godheade is one: and the firſt or ſecond another. But the Holy ghoſt is ſaide to bee the thirde perſon of the Godhead: and this not in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as if there were in God any firſt or laſt in time, but in reſpect of the order or manner of beeing: Becauſe the Holy Ghoſt hath his eſſence from the Father and the Son, from both which hee proceeded from euerlaſting, as alſo hee is the ſpirite of both. In like manner the Son is called the ſecond perſon, becauſe he is of the Father. The Father the firſt perſon, becauſe he is of none. 2. <hi>The holie ghoſt is in expreſſe woordes called another.</hi> Iohn 14.16. <hi>J will praie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he ſhal giue you another comforter.</hi> 1. Iohn 5.7. <hi>There are three which beare record in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the Holie Ghoſt: and theſe three are one.</hi> 3. <hi>He is ſent of the Father and the Son.</hi> Therefore he is another from both. For none is ſent of himſelfe. One maie come of his owne wil, or of himſelfe. But none can be ſent of himſelfe. <hi>John</hi> 15.26. <hi>I will ſend him vnto you from the Father.</hi> Iohn 14.26. <hi>The Father ſendeth him in my name.</hi> 4. <hi>The holie Ghoſt hath diſtinct attributes or properties perſonal from them.</hi> The holy Ghoſt onely proceeded from the Father and the Sonne. He alone appeared in the ſhape of a Doue, in the likeneſſe of fire; not the Father or the ſon. Chriſt alſo is ſaid to haue beene conceiued not by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or the Sonne, but by the holie Ghoſt, that is, by the immediate vertue and efficacie of the holy Ghoſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is another from the Father and the Sonne; which is diligently to be obſerued. For the aduerſaries heereof, being conuicted of the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>grant that he is a ſubſiſtent, but of the Father.</hi> Obiection. <hi>The vertue and power of the Father is the Father himſelfe: the holie ghoſt is called the vertue and power of the Father: therefore the holie ghoſt is the Father himſelfe.</hi> Aunſwere. This reaſon is Sophiſtical, becauſe vertue is not taken for the ſame in the Maior, for which it is taken in the Minor. <hi>For in the Maior it is taken for the power of the Father: in the Minor for the perſon by whome the Father ſheweth forth his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the holie Ghost is equall with the Father and
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:19538:316"/>
the Sonne, theſe argumentes doe proue.</hi> 1. <hi>The eſſence of the Father and the Sonne is communicated vnto him:</hi> becauſe hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from both, and is the ſpirite of both. But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in God which is not his eſſence. Seeing then that is indiuiſible, it muſt needes be whole and the ſame commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated vnto him: which is in the Father and the Sonne. As the ſpirite of man, which is in man, is of the eſſence of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the ſpirit of God, which is in God, is of the eſſence of God. By this it appeareth, <hi>What is the proceeding of the holy ghoſt, namely, the communicating of the diuine eſſence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the third perſon of the god-heade alone receiueth the ſame and whole or entire eſſence from the Father and the Sonne, as from him whoſe ſpirite hee is.</hi> And <hi>that the holy ghoſt proceedeth from the Sonne alſo:</hi> is proued by certaine reaſons. Firſt, <hi>Becauſe hee is called the Sonnes ſpirite.</hi> Roman. 8.9. <hi>If anie man hath not the ſpirite of Chriſt, the ſame is not his.</hi> Galat. 4.6. <hi>He hath ſent forth the ſpirite of his Sonne into your heartes. The ſpirite of his Sonne,</hi> that is, not giuen vnto the Sonne of the Father, but exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and proceeding, as of the Fathers, ſo of the Sonnes ſubſtaunce, ſeeing the Sonne is equall and conſubſtantiall with the Father. Secondly, <hi>becauſe the Sonne together with the Father giueth him.</hi> Iohn 15.26. And Iohn 20.22. <hi>Receiue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſt.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe the holy ghoſt receiueth the wiſedome of the ſonne, which hee reueileth vnto vs.</hi> Iohn. 16.14. <hi>Hee ſhal receiue of mine, and ſhall ſhew it vnto you.</hi> But ſeeing the holy Ghoſt is true God, conſubſtantiall with the Father and the Sonne, he cannot receiue any thing but of him, of whoſe ſubſtance he is. Wherfore he proceedeth of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Son, becauſe he receiueth that of him which is the ſonnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The holy ghoſtes equalitie with the Father and the Son is proued by thoſe diuine attributes &amp; properties which are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted and communicated vnto the holy ghoſt:</hi> as <hi>eternitie;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee created heauen and earth, and becauſe God was neuer without his ſpirit. Likewiſe, <hi>omnipotency,</hi> and <hi>omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,</hi> that is, the knowing of al things. 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſearcheth al thinges, yea, the deepe thinges of god.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>immenſitie</hi> or vnmeaſurableneſſe, as who dwelleth whole &amp; entirely in al the Elect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>The ſame diuine woorkes, which are attributed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:19538:317"/>
and the Sonne, are alſo attributed to the holy ghoſt,</hi> and in thoſe both the general and vniuerſal workes, and alſo thoſe miraculous workes, which conſiſt in inſtituting and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Church. So in <hi>Iob.</hi> 33.4. creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is attributed vnto him. <hi>The ſpirit of god hath made me, &amp; the breath of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath giuen me life.</hi> Other woorkes are attributed to him alſo in other places; eſpecially, that he quickneth, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth, illuminateth, and worketh miracles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Equall &amp; the ſame honor is giuen to the holie ghoſt, which is giuen both to the Father and the Sonne.</hi> To no creature, but to God alone is to be giuen diuine honour, that is honour proper to God onely; But this is giuen to the holy Ghoſt: Therefore he is god, equal with the Father and the Son. 1. <hi>John.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three, which beare witneſſe in Heauen; The Father, the Woord, and the holie Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> The holy Ghoſt therefore is the ſame true God with the father and the Sonne. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, &amp; the holy ghoſt.</hi> By this teſtimony we are taught, Firſt, <hi>That we are baptiſed alſo into the name, faith, woorſhip, and religion of the holy ghoſt.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the holy Ghoſt is author alſo of baptiſme and the miniſterie.</hi> In like ſott alſo wee beleeue in him. That ſinne which is committed againſt him is not remitted. We are his temple.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Thoſe things which are ſpoken in the old teſtament of God or Jehouah, are applied in the newe teſtament to the holie ghoſt.</hi> Obiection. <hi>Hee that is ſent is not equall with him that ſendeth; The holy Ghoſt is ſent, and the Father and the Sonne ſend him: Therefore the holy Ghoſt is not equall with the Father and the Sonne.</hi> Anſwere. We deny the maior: For hee that is ſent may bee equall with him that ſendeth. For Chriſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent of the Father, yet is hee equall with the Father. This ſending dooth not betoken any ſeruile ſubiection. Obiection 2. <hi>Hee that receiueth of another is not equall with him who giueth: The holie ghoſt receiueth of the Father and the Sonne: Therefore he is not equall with both.</hi> Anſwere. The Maior is true of one that receiueth of another but a part and not the whole, but the holy Ghoſt receiueth the ſame and whole eſſence of the father and the Sonne: Againe, it is true of him that receiueth in time or ſucceſſiuely but
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:19538:317"/>
the holy Ghoſt receiued before all time. Thirdly, to the Minor we ſay, That he receiued, as touching the ordeining and ſending of him to vs, to teach vs immediatly: But this ſending eſtabliſheth and confirmeth his equalitie; becauſe it is a diuine woork: and the ordeining of him to teach vs immediately doth not leſſen but ſtrengthen his equality.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>That the holy ghoſt is one and the ſame true god with the Father and the Sonne,</hi> is prooued by theſe reaſons. 1 <hi>Becauſe he is the Fathers and the Sonnes ſpirit.</hi> But the diuine eſſence cannot be multiplied, as neither can an other bee created: nor the ſame diuided. Therefore the ſelfeſame and that whole muſt needes bee communicated to the holy Ghoſt, which is the eſſence of the Father and the Sonne. From both which the holy ghoſt proceedeth, as the ſpirit of God in God, and of God. 2 <hi>There is but one true God.</hi> The holy ghoſt is true God: Therefore the holy ghoſt is that one and the ſame true God with the Father and the Sonne, conſubſtantiall with both. 3 <hi>There is but one Iehouah,</hi> that is, one diuine Eſſence or Being, one eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, who alone is of none, but himſelfe communicateth his beeing to al thinges, and preſerueth it in them. The holy Ghoſt is Iehouah: Therefore he is the ſame with the Father &amp; the Son, God conſubſtantial with both. Obiect. <hi>He that is of another, is not conſubſtantiall with him, or is not the ſame with him of or from whom he is: The holy Ghoſt is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne. Therefore hee is not the ſame with them or conſubſtantiall.</hi> Anſwere. 1 The Maior is true in creatures, but not in God. 2 There is an ambiguity in this terme, <hi>To be of another.</hi> Hee that is of another, and hath not the ſame or whole eſſence, is not conſubſtantiall. But the holy ghoſt hath the ſame and whole eſſence, and therefore it followeth only that he is not the ſame perſon. Therefore by inuerting the argument we aunſwere; That hee who is of the Father, and from the Father, is conſubſtantial with him, as likewiſe with the Son, of and from whom he alſo is.</p>

maketh the Apoſtles couragious and bold, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore timerous, and wrapped, and entangled with manie doubtes.

All thoſe giftes we may briefly compriſe in this diuiſion. <hi>The giftes of the holie ghoſt either are common to the godly, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, or proper to the godly onely. Thoſe which are common to the godly and vngodly, are giuen either to certaine men and at certain times, or at al times, and to all the members of the Church. Thoſe which are giuen at certaine times and to certaine men,</hi> are theſe: The gift of miracles, &amp; of tongues, prophecies, the faith of miracles; and theſe were neceſſarie for the Apoſtles &amp; the primitiue Church, when the goſpell was firſt to bee diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Thoſe which are giuen at all times, and to all the members of the church,</hi> are theſe: the giftes of tongues, and of knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the gift of interpretation. Theſe are alwaies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the church, and belong to the maintainaunce and preſeruation of the Miniſterie, and are now alſo giuen to euery member of the church, according to the meaſure of Chriſtes gift, as the calling and vocation of euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber needeth. <hi>The giftes of the holy ghoſt proper vnto the godlie,</hi> are, iuſtifieng faith, praier, loue, and other giftes profitable to ſaluation. Obiection. <hi>Many out of the church haue hadde tongues and ſciences: the tongues therefore and ſciences are not the giftes of the holy ghoſt.</hi> Aunſwere. The tongues and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of the church are alſo the giftes of the holy ghoſt, but by a general working of god, which is without the true knowledge of him. But in the church, the tongues and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are the giftes of the holy ghoſt, ioined with the true knowledge of god.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer <hi>al thoſe giftes</hi> (as wee ſaide) <hi>are fitlie referred to thoſe ſixe principal partes before numbered of the holie ghoſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:19538:319"/>
as the knowledge of tongues, and of ſciences to his function of teaching: and that miraculous and extraordinarie gift of tongues partly to his function of ruling</hi> (for the holy ghoſt did rule and gouerne their tongues) <hi>partly to his function of teaching and confirming.</hi> So alſo <hi>the gift of Prophecie and interpretation belongeth to his office of teaching.</hi> For hee teacheth both by il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the mindes within by his vertue, and by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them without by the word. <hi>The inſtitution &amp; ordinance of the Sacramentes appertaineth to his office of teaching, but chiefly to his office of confirming. Faith and conuerſion belong to his office of regenerating and conioyning vs with Chriſt. That hee is the ſpirite of praier, inſtructing vs how to praie, belongeth to his office of ruling &amp; gouerning.</hi> In like ſort the reſt of the gifts maie bee referred to certaine partes of the Holy Ghoſtes office.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the holy ghoſt, in reſpect of this his office, hath diuerſe titles of commendation in the Scripture. For hereof hee is called, 1. <hi>The ſpirite of adoption;</hi> becauſe hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth vs of the fatherly good wil of god towards vs, and is a witneſſe vnto vs of that free goodneſſe &amp; mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the father embraceth vs in his onely begotten ſonne. Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>By this ſpirit we crie Abba Father.</hi> 2. <hi>He is called the earneſt and ſeale of our inheritance;</hi> becauſe hee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs our ſaluation. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>It is god which ſtabliſheth vs with you in Chriſt, and hath annointed vs: who hath alſo ſealed vs &amp; hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earneſt of the ſpirit in our hearts.</hi> Eph. 1.13.14. <hi>In which goſpell alſo after that yee beleeued, yee were ſealed with the holy ſpirite of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance.</hi> 3. Hee is called <hi>Life,</hi> becauſe he quickneth vs: or (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith) <hi>The ſpirite of Life,</hi> who mortifieth the oulde man, and quickneth the new. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>The Law of the ſpirite of life which is in Christ Jeſus hath freed mee from the Lawe of ſin and of death.</hi> 4. He is called <hi>Water,</hi> whereby he refreſheth vs being almoſt dead in ſinne, and maketh vs fruitful that we may bring foorth fruit. 5. Hee is called <hi>Fire,</hi> becauſe hee dooth daily burne vp and conſume concupiſcences and vices in vs, and kindleth our heartes with the loue of God and our neighbour. 6. He is called <hi>the Fountaine,</hi> becauſe all celeſtiall riches doe flow vnto vs from him. 7. Hee is called <hi>the Spirite of praier.</hi> 8. <hi>The Oile of gladneſſe:</hi> Heb. 1.9. <hi>Wherefore
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:19538:319"/>
god, euen thy God hath annointed thee with the Oile of gladneſſe.</hi> 9. He is called <hi>the Comforter,</hi> becauſe he worketh faith in vs, and purifieth our conſciences, and ſo comforteth vs, that we exult and reioice in afflictions. 10. He is called <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour,</hi> becauſe <hi>Roman.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The ſpirite maketh requeſt or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs with ſighes, which cannot bee expreſſed.</hi> 11. Hee is called laſtly, <hi>the Spirite of truth, of wiſedom, of ioie, of gladnes, of the fear of God, of boldneſſe, and the like.</hi>

For thoſe alſo doth the Father and the ſonne work by the holie ghoſt; according as it is ſaide,</hi> Wiſe. 1.7. <hi>The ſpirite of the Lord filleth all the world.</hi> Aunſwere. To the aſſigning of a work as proper vnto the holie ghoſt, is required, not onelie that it be immediatlie done by him, but in ſuch wiſe alſo, as that he be acknowledged and worſhipped therein.

Church or aſſemblie of thoſe that are called, both to the Elect, and to hypocrits;</hi> and furder he is not otherwiſe giuen vnto them, than as themſelues alſo be willing, and deſirous of him: and then is augmented and encreaſed in them if they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere. <hi>To the Elect he is giuen not</hi> onelie as concerning the knowledge of gods doctrine, but alſo as concerning rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, faith, and conuerſion: becauſe, beſides that he kindleth in them the knowledge of Gods truth and wil, he doth further alſo regenerate them, and endowe them with true faith and conuerſion.

                  <p>Hence it is apparent, <hi>how the knowledge of tongues, ſciences, and the like gifts beſtowed on the Heathen, differ from thoſe which are bestowed on the church.</hi> For they who amongeſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then excelled in the knowledge of tongues and good arts, and thinges profitable, had indeede the giftes of God, but not the holy ghoſt; whom none are ſaide to haue, but they whom he hath ſanctified, and who acknowledge him to be the author of the giftes receiued.

local motion in God, but his preſence &amp; operation, which hee ſheweth and exerciſeth in the church. For the Holie ghoſt is ſpread abroad euery where &amp; filleth both heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth: In which reſpect <hi>hee is ſaid to bee giuen, ſent, powred out,</hi> when by his effectual and forcible preſence he doth create, ſtirre vp, and by litle and litle perfect his gifts in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>HEE is giuen after an ordinarie waie by the miniſterie of the Woord, and by the vſe of the Sacramentes:</hi> and firſt, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting himſelfe vnto vs through the ſtudying and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the doctrine of the goſpel. For when he is known of vs, he wil communicate himſelfe vnto vs; and when hee ſheweth himſelfe to be knowen of vs, he dooth alſo renue and reforme our hearts. So did hee woorke in the Elect by Peters Sermon in the daie of Pentecoſt, <hi>Actes</hi> 2.37. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hee wrought in Cornelius and the reſt there preſent, by the ſame Peter ſpeaking, <hi>Actes</hi> 10.44. <hi>But yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he doth ſo work by the word and Sacraments, as that he is not tied to theſe meanes.</hi> For hee conuerted Paul in his iourney: Hee furniſhed Iohn Baptiſt with his giftes while hee was yet in the wombe.

ſpirite is in order of nature before faith, but in time both are together: becauſe the firſt beginning of faith is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the holy ghoſt. 2.

Al obey, acknowledging by their profeſſion, that ſinnes ought not to bee maintained. <hi>But it is neceſſarie that this third mark ſhould be added:</hi> becauſe they ſhoulde mocke God, who woulde ſaie that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this Doctrine of Chriſt, and would not frame their liues according vnto it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe and teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Sonne &amp; the holy Ghoſt; Teaching them to obſerue all thinges whatſoeuer I haue commaunded you.</hi> In theſe woordes of Chriſt are all thoſe three markes of the Church conteined. Obiection. 2.<note place="margin">Not all, that challenge theſe markes, are the Church, becauſe all haue them not, though they challenge them.</note> 
                     <hi>But thoſe which all Schiſmatiques and heretiques doe challenge vnto them, are not the markes of the true Church.

For we are not to ſee whether they chalenge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but whether they haue them. So alſo woulde it follow, that the heauenly bleſſings, which are proper to the true Church, are theirs alſo, becauſe they challenge them. Obiect. 3. <hi>Without which the church cannot bee, that is a marke thereof. But without the ordinarie ſucceſſion of Biſhops the church cannot be. Therefore it is a marke thereof.</hi> Anſ.

By ordinarie ſucceſſion in the miniſterie,<note place="margin">The ordinarie ſucceſſion of Biſhops no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie marke of the Church.</note> is meant the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of miniſters in the ſame true doctrine and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacramentes.

But in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this obiection is vnderſtoode that there ſhoulde bee an ordinarie ſucceſſion into the ſame place, whether they teach the ſame doctrine or a diuerſe from it. And ſo alſo it ſhould be a tying of the Church to a certaine Citie, Region, and ſo foorth. Saint Auguſtine againſt Manichaeus his Epiſtle, cap 5. ſheweth how he was brought to the faith of the Catholique Church. For hee ſaith, <hi>That hee obeied the catholiques, when they ſaid, Beleeue the goſpell:</hi> and there he bringeth forth that common ſaieng: <hi>I woulde not beleeue the goſpell, except the autoritie of the catholique church mooued mee thereunto.</hi> By the teſtimonie therefore of the church he was mooued to reade the goſpell, and to beleeue that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie doctrine was conteined therein. But doth hee, after hee beleeued the goſpell, promiſe that hee would beleeue the church more than the goſpel, if the church determine, or propound anie thing, which is either contrarie to the goſpell, or can bee prooued by no teſtimonie of Scripture? This doubtles Auguſtine neuer meant. Naie, elſewhere he denounceth <hi>Anathema, and biddeth a curſe come to them, who declare any thing beſides that which wee haue receiued in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Lawe and Goſpell.</hi> And in the ſelfe-ſame place he witneſſeth, <hi>That he, becauſe he beleeueth the Goſpell, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Manichaeus, for that hee readeth nothing in the Goſpell of Manichaeus Apoſtleſhip.</hi> Therefore traditions or ordinances of the church, bring vs vnto the ſcripture, and ty vs to that voice which ſoundeth in the Scripture.</p>

For there is one Vniuerſall Church of all places, &amp; degrees of life, neither is it tied to a certaine place &amp; king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or to certain ſucceſſion. 2 <hi>In reſpect of times:</hi> Becauſe there is but one true Church of all times, which alſo is at all times ſo Catholicke, as that it is diſperſed through the whol world, nether is at any time tied to any certain place. <hi>Jt is not called Catholicke,</hi> becauſe it poſſeſſeth many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:19538:326"/>
For <hi>Catholicke</hi> is a title giuen vnto the Church in the Apoſtles time, for before time the Church was limited within narrowe bondes. Nowe, <hi>that there is but one Church of al times and ages from the beginning of the world vnto the end,</hi> it is out of doubt. For, 1 <hi>It is manifeſted that the Church hath euer been. Neither can Abrahams daies be obiected, as if before he was called there had beene no worſhip of the true God in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and himſelfe had beene after his calling alone without anie others.</hi> For before his calling he held the foundations and grounds of Doctrine of the true God, though it were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſuperſtitions mingled therewith. Againe, <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> liued at the ſame time, <hi>who was the Priest of the moſt high God;</hi> and therefore neither was Abraham after his calling alone, but there were others beſides him, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the true God, whoſe prieſt was Melchiſedec. 2 <hi>That the Church, as it hath beene euer, ſo ſhall alſo continue euer,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by theſe teſtimonies. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My woordes ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed.</hi> Ier. 33.20. <hi>If the night and day may bee chaunged, then ſhall my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant alſo be changed.</hi> Mat. 28.20. <hi>I am with you alway vntill the end of the world.</hi> Moreouer Chriſt was euer and euer ſhal be King, Head, and Prieſt of the Church. Wherefore the Church was euer, and euer ſhall be. And hence alſo it is manifeſt, <hi>That the Church of both teſtaments</hi> is one and the ſame; that which is confirmed alſo by the article folowing. For Chriſt is the ſanctifier of his Church, who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to men of both teſtaments. Hither appertaineth the Queſtion <hi>of the authoritie of the Church.</hi> Which I omit. In this we wil conſider here onely that opinion or ſaying, <hi>The church doth not erre.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the church may bee ſaide not to erre.</note> Which is true after this ſort. Firſt, <hi>the whole</hi> doth not erre, though ſome members thereof doe er.

And by this vnion chriſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his Saints, &amp; maketh them like vnto himſelfe by the ſame ſpirit which is common to both, &amp; worketh the like in both, reſeruing ſtil a difference in working: for in the heade he worketh al gifts &amp; graces, &amp; thoſe moſt perfectly: in the members he worketh thoſe gifts which are conuenient for euerie one, &amp; ſo much as is for euery one requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.

The ſame is refuted by that often alleadged compariſon of the head and members. For thoſe are coherent and grow together, but are not in a mixture, nor mingled one with another. Whence alſo wee maie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily iudge <hi>of that communion, which is in the Sacramentes.</hi> For the Sacramentes ſeale nothing elſe but that which the word promiſeth. But to let this paſſe, the ſame is alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by refuted, that this communion muſt be continued for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For to this ende dooth Chriſt communicate himſelfe to vs, that he may dwel in vs: Wherefore ſuch as is his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and dwelling, ſuch is his communion: But chriſts abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and dwelling is perpetual: Therefore his communion alſo is perpetuall. This argument is moſt ſtrong and firme, and therefore for the aſſoyling it they haue beene faine to deuiſe their Vbiquite. For to obtaine that other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they woulde haue, they muſt needes affirme, that Chriſt dwelleth alwaies bodily in al his Saints.</p>

Corint. 15.13. <hi>If there bee no reſurrection of the deade, then is Chriſt not riſen: And if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vaine, and your faith is alſo vaine.</hi>

Seeing therefore God dooth moſt certainelie in his good time accompliſh that, which hee promiſeth to the godly, and menaceth to the wicked; it followeth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie that the dead muſt riſe againe. 2. <hi>The mercie of God is perfect, as which extendeth it ſelfe to the whole man, and which will haue vs wholy ſaued: Therefore our bodies alſo ſhal riſe again.</hi> 3. <hi>The mercie and loue of God towardes the godly is perpetuall

But they ſinne both in their whole bodie and in their ſoule. Therefore their bodies alſo muſt be raiſed againe,</hi> becauſe they ought no leſſe in body than in ſoule to ſuffer eternal pains. 5. <hi>Chriſt is riſen: therefore wee alſo ſhall riſe.</hi> This ſequele is moſt ſure. For, firſt, <hi>Chriſt therefore roſe againe, that hee might raiſe vs.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Chriſt is our head, and we his members.</hi> Seeing then Chriſt our head is riſen, we alſo his members doubtles ſhal riſe. For the glorie of the head requireth this, that he haue his members ſutable &amp; in like condition with him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the members ſhould continue rotten, the head ſhould not be glorious. Thirdly, <hi>The ſame ſpirite is in vs, which is in Chriſt raiſed: he ioineth and vniteth vs with Chriſt, and worketh the ſame in vs, which he doth in Chriſt, neither is at anie time not like himſelfe. But he hath raiſed Chriſt: Therefore alſo hee will raiſe vs.</hi> 6. <hi>It is ſaide that Chriſt ſhall haue an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdome, but this he ſhould not haue, if our bodies ſhould alwaies continue in death: for neither would it ſuffice that our ſoules are immortall, or eternal without our bodies.</hi> For that Chriſts kingdome may be eternall, he muſt haue eternall ſubiects, and thoſe wholy eternall. Therefore our bodies alſo ſhall riſe, that ſo wee whole may bee ſubiect eternally vnto Chriſt our king. 7. <hi>Chriſt is a perfect Sauiour, becauſe he hath ſaued and reconciled to god whole man. Therefore our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt bodie alſo ſhall be raiſed by Chriſt, and riſe againe.</hi> 8. <hi>Chriſt is not of leſſe force to ſaue than Adam to leeſe.</hi> Nay, Chriſt hath reſtored vnto vs al that which Adam loſt &amp; deſtroied by ſinning, yea and far more and greater things by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Adam had loſt from vs among other gifts the eternall life alſo of our bodies. Therefore Chriſt hath restored it vnto vs,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, we ſhall certainely riſe againe. 9. <hi>God is the God of whole man.</hi> This reaſon Chriſt alſo vſeth againſt the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces: <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31. <hi>Haue yee not read, what is ſpoken vnto you of God, ſaying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Jſaac, and

the god of Jacob? God is not the god of the dead, but of the liuing:</hi> And ſo God is the God of whole man, not of a part onely. For if he were God of a part, that is, of the ſoule onely, he were not perfectly and fullie our God. 10. <hi>He publiſhed his lawe vnto man, after the fall: Therefore hee will haue man once keepe it.</hi> But that is not done in this life. Therefore it ſhall be done in the life to come, and therefore men ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. 11. <hi>The wages of ſinne is death. Therefore ſinne being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, death ſhalbe aboliſhed: and ſo death being aboliſhed, we ſhall riſe againe vnto euerlaſting life.</hi> To this end alſo our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were made, that in them as temples the holy Ghoſt might dwell for euer.</p>

And laſtly he ſaith <hi>that his thoughtes periſh,</hi> which is not, that the ſoule is after this life bereaued of reaſon, iudgement, and ſenſe of the mercy or wrath of God, but that his purpoſes and counſels are made fruſtrate, which man in this life had ſetled with him-ſelfe to bring to paſſe: in which ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 112.10. <hi>The deſire of the wicked ſhal periſh.</hi>

They who are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dead, whether before or after the death of the bodie, that is, they who are depriued of gods grace, &amp; forſaken and reiected of god, and are in hell, that is, in the place &amp;

torments of the damned, or elſe in this life deſpairing and deſtitute of comfort, ſhall not praiſe god at all, neither in this life, nor in the life to come. But they who are dead, not ſpiritually, but corporally onely, albeit they ſhall not praiſe god in this life while their bodies are in hell, that is, in the graue, yet in ſoul they ſhal not ceaſe to acknowledge and praiſe god in the other life, vntill when receiuing their bodies againe, they ſhall magnifie him in both, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial eternity. But in the meane ſeaſon, becauſe god will alſo be agniſed and magnified of men in this life, therefore both the whole Church, and euerie one of the faithfull, not only pray that they may not fall into that forſaking, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that ſenſe of gods wrath, wherewith the wicked are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; but alſo deſire that they may bee in this mortall life preſerued and defended, vntill the end thereof by god appointed be expired. For the Saints doe not ſimply ſtand in feare of the bodily death and graue; but that they may not be forſaken of god, neither fall into deſperation and deſtruction, or their enimies inſult againſt god, when they are ouerthrowen; this with daily and ardent praiers and petitions they beg and craue continually.</p>
                  <p>Nowe that which the aduerſaries ad farther out of the Pſal. 146.2. <hi>I will praiſe the Lord during my life: as long as J haue anie beeing, I will ſing vnto my God;</hi> this maketh nothing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For he reſtraineth not the praiſing of God to the time of his mortal life, but only he ſaith that he wil ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all that time in Gods praiſes, which notwithſtanding in manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places he extendeth to continue al eternity; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>I wil praiſe the Lord continually.</hi> But oftentimes this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>vntill,</hi> or, <hi>as long as,</hi> ſignifieth a continuance of the time going before ſome euent, without any excluding of the time following: as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>He muſt raign vntil he hath put al his enemies vnder his feete.</hi>

Iob 3.11. <hi>Why died I not, when I came out of the womb?</hi> Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Iob dooth not denie, the ſoules after death to bee, liue, feele and vnderſtand, but only he ſaith, the miſeries of this preſent life are not felt: If they vrge, <hi>that neither the euils of the life to come are felt; becauſe then Job ſhoulde wiſh for a bad chaunge:</hi> we aunſwere, that Iob wiſheth not for the death of the wicked, but of the godly. But if they ad furder, <hi>That Job dooth make Kings and Princes alſo which gather gold vnto them, ſmal and great, that is, al men, good and bad, partakers of this reſt:</hi> our aunſwere is out of the proceſſe and courſe of his whole ſpeech, that Iob dooth not teach here, what is the ſtate of men after this life, but onely deſireth to bee rid of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſerie, and therefore through humane infirmity and impatiency, doth compare the ſenſe and feeling of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſeries with the death and ſtate of the dead, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be; as they who are grieuouſly tormented with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſſes and calamities prefer any thing whatſoeuer before that which they ſuffer. So alſo chapter 7. hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as one deſpairing of deliuerie in this life. <hi>Remember that my life is but a wind, and that mine eie ſhal not returne to ſee pleaſure.</hi> For ſo hee expoundeth himſelfe, when he addeth: <hi>He ſhal returne no more to his houſe, neither ſhall his place knowe him anie more.</hi> So likewiſe cap. 17. <hi>My breath is corrupt, and the graue is readie for me.</hi> They are woords of one deſpairing of life and ſaluation, god being wrath and angry. But chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 34.14. when it is ſaid; <hi>If he ſet his hart vpon man, and gather vnto him ſelfe his ſpirit, and his breath, Al fleſh ſhal periſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> it is not ſaide that the ſoule dooth ſleepe, or periſh, but that by the departure thereof the body dieth and is diſſolued.</p>
                  <p>Further they adde: <hi>Jf preſently after death the godlie were bleſſed, then iniurie was doone vnto them, who were called againe into this mortall life.</hi> But to this we aunſwere, That neither god can be iniurious to any man, whereas he is in no mans debt: neither can any thing happen better or more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto the godly, than to ſerue for the manifeſting of gods glory, either by life or by death.

                     <note place="margin">What life is in generall.</note>
                     <hi>LIFE</hi> is defined among Philoſophers diuerſly; and it is indeede a word of diuers ſignifications, &amp; ſignifiyng di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things. <hi>In generall it is, either the verie exiſtence and being of the ſoul with the bodie, or the operation of a liung thing:</hi> that is, it ſignifieth to be, or to doe thoſe things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto a liuing nature, for it is taken both for the firſt act and for the ſecond. Therefore death is the deſtruction of a liuing thing and of the power or facultie of woorking. Or, <hi>Life is an aptitude of a liuing thing to worke the operations proper vnto it, and is alſo the operations themſelues,</hi> by reaſon of the Vnion of the bodie with the ſoule. Generally, <hi>both as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching god, and Angels, and men, it is the existence or being of a
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:19538:344"/>
liuing thing, and the facultie or power wherewith euerie liuing thing beeing endewed dooth exerciſe the operations and actions of life.</hi> Spirits alſo liue: but they haue not that from life, but from their very nature &amp; eſſence. Now when we mention euerlaſting life, we reſtraine the word: for then it ſpeaketh of the euerlaſting life of men &amp; Angels. <hi>That is called Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> 1. <hi>Which hath neither beginning nor ending.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Life euerlaſting hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but no end.</note> 2 <hi>Which hath no beginning, and hath an ending,</hi> as the decrees of god. 3. <hi>Which hath a beginning, but ſhal haue no end,</hi> as euerlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>But this queſtion ſeemeth vnexplicable, becauſe it is ſaid thereof. <hi>Jſai.</hi> 64.4. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Neither eie hath ſeene, neither eare hath heard, neither came into mans heart the things which god hath prepared for them that loue him.</hi> Yet we will ſee what may be knowen concerning this queſtion of the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Life in generall ſignifieth to liue, or to be, as wee reſtraine beeing to a thing liuing:</hi> that is, to bee endued with a ſoule, which ſoule is that, whereby we liue; and the naturall life is the remaining or dwelling of the ſoule in a liuing bodie; and the operation of the ſoule, or the facultie of the ſoule working thoſe actions which are proper to a liuing thing. For the ſoule is the eſſential forme of life: which who haue, liue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Euerlaſting life is nothing elſe but to be: as we reſtrain being to a regenerate man: which To be,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The Definition of ſacramentes.</note> 
                     <hi>ordained and inſtituted by God, that by them he might the more declare and ſeal the promiſe of his goſpel vnto vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The partes of this definition are in number three: The firſt part apperteineth <hi>to the kinde of Sacramentes,</hi> the latter two <hi>to their difference. To the kind,</hi> whereof they are, it apperteineth, that <hi>they are ſacred ſignes &amp; ſeals,</hi> that is, diuine,<note place="margin">The ſacraments are ſacred ſeals.</note> &amp; ſignifieng or betokening ſacred things, ſuch as belong to gods worſhip and the ſaluation of men. <hi>A ſigne and a ſeale differ one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, as a general thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thing more ſpecial.</hi> For euerie ſeale is a ſigne, but not euery ſigne a ſeal. <hi>A ſeale</hi> certifieth and confirmeth a thing: <hi>A ſigne</hi> onely ſheweth it. <hi>A ſign is a thing ſignifieng ſomewhat elſe than that which it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſenſes:</hi> or, <hi>a ſigne is that, whereby the vnderſtanding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth ſome thinges elſe, beſides the ſigne it ſelfe.</hi> So wordes are the ſignes of thinges. Moreouer <hi>ſignes are of two ſortes:</hi> ſome <hi>are onely ſignifieng,</hi> others <hi>are confirming alſo,</hi> that is, ſuch ſignes, as whereby wee reaſon &amp; conclude alſo of the thing which they ſignifie, neither onely vnderſtand by them, what they ſignifie, but alſo argue and reaſon from them, ſo that wee are not left in doubt or vncertaine, whether that bee true or falſe, which they ſignifie. <hi>Sacramentes</hi> therefore <hi>ſerue in the ſame ſteede, that pledges doe:</hi> for both they ſignifie that there is ſome thing promiſed vnto thee, &amp; withal they aſſure and confirme the ſame vnto thee, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is alſo added, that they are <hi>ſeales. Now theſe ſignes and
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:19538:357"/>
ſeales are called ſacred and holy,</hi> becauſe they are giuen vs of God. For holy and ſacred thinges are of two ſortes, 1. <hi>Thoſe thinges which God performeth vnto vs.</hi> 2. <hi>Thoſe thinges which wee performe vnto God.</hi> Theſe ſignes are ſaid to <hi>be obiect to our eyes,</hi> that is, viſible: bicauſe they ought to be ſuch, ſeing they are to ſignify things inuiſible. Moreouer they muſt be ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt be ſtaies &amp; props of faith, &amp; be perceiued by the outward ſenſe, that the inward ſenſe may therby be moued. For that which thou ſeeſt not, is no ſigne. And hee that maketh a ſign to be inuiſible, doth imply a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; ſpeaketh contraries. For not the ſigns ſignifieng, but the things ſignified are inuiſible. Whence it is, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers define a ſacrament thus: <hi>A ſacrament is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne of inuiſible grace.</hi>

                     <hi>To the difference of ſacramentes</hi> (whereby they haue their ſeuerall being as it were, and are different from other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thinges) appertaine theſe two properties. 1. <hi>That they are ordeined and inſtituted by God</hi> 2. <hi>That they are inſtituted to this end, that God may by them ſeal &amp; aſſure vnto vs his promiſe. And that theſe ſignes were inſtituted of God alone, it is certaine.</hi> For as God alone pronounceth concerning his will, &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs the ſame, and giueth vs his promiſe of grace; ſo he alone aſſureth and confirmeth this promiſe vnto vs by his ſacraments. Wherefore God alone hath autoritie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and ordaine a ſacrament. And <hi>this inſtitution of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Conteineth two thinges.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God onely may ordaine a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 1. <hi>The appointing and commanding of the rite and ceremonies:</hi> 2. <hi>The promiſe of grace annexed to this rite, whereby God promiſeth that he will giue the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto ſuch as lawfullie and rightly vſe the ſigne.</hi> And theſe thinges are proper to God alone. For as the receiuing into grace and fauour, and remiſſion of ſinnes belongeth to god alone: So alſo doth the promiſe thereof. And as god alone inſtituteth &amp; appointeth vnto him-ſelfe his publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo he alone is able to confirme vnto vs by his publique worſhip, and miniſterie, &amp; by his ſacraments, the promiſe of grace, that is, the promiſe of receiuing all bleſſinges &amp; benefits neceſſarie to ſaluation, which are ſignified &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ceremonies and rites of ſacraments. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention is alſo made <hi>of the promiſe</hi> in the definition of ſacraments, that ſo that difference of ſacraments may
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:19538:357"/>
bee the better perceiued &amp; diſcerned: becauſe god hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to men teſtimonies alſo of other things. <hi>This promiſe of grace</hi> the ſcripture calleth alſo <hi>the promiſe of the Goſpell:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe god doth eſpeciallie and chieflie in the goſpell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it vnto vs. And further hee declareth the ſame being promiſed in the goſpel, and ſheweth it more clearlie by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and this, <hi>by reaſon of the analogie, proportion and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, which the ſignes haue with thoſe things which are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by thoſe ſacramental ſignes.</hi> For as a ſimilitude declareth and explaneth that whereof it is a ſimilitude, ſo the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments declare that, whereof they are ſacraments. And as a true ſimilitude is not vnderſtood, except the analogie of the ſimilitude be vnderſtood: ſo neither are the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; except wee vnderſtand the analogie and proportion which they haue with the thing ſignified. Neither doth god by his ſacramentes onely declare the promiſe of the goſpel, but alſo ſealeth the ſame vnto vs. 1. <hi>Becauſe god when hee ſpeaketh with vs, whether it be by his Worde, or by a ſigne, is alwaies alike true.</hi> And therefore hee aſſureth and maketh vs certaine of his will, both by his worde and by his ſacraments. 2. <hi>Becauſe ſacramentes are ſeales and pledges annexed to the promiſe,</hi> which who ſo vſeth rightly, that is with true faith &amp; repentance; vnto him thoſe pledges and ſeals ſeale and confirme moſt aſſuredlie, that hee ſhall bee partaker of the thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſignified, which are ſpirituall.</p>

                     <hi>3</hi> Jn what Sacraments differ from ſacrifices.</head>
                  <p>WE muſt hold and obſerue a difference betweene Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Sacraments,<note place="margin">Sacraments &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices differ in their chiefe end</note> that we may knowe what to do, when we come vnto them. <hi>Now they differ in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal &amp; chiefe end. For ſacraments are only ceremonies. Sacrifices may be ceremonies &amp; moral works alſo, as the ſacrifices of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing</hi> are our works towards God, whereby wee yeeld due obedience and honour vnto God; ſuch are the ſacrifices of praiſe and thankfulneſſe. <hi>A ſacrament,</hi> is gods work toward vs, wherein he giueth ſome thing, to wit, the ſignes and the things ſigned; &amp; wherein he teſtifieth of his offering &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his benefits vpon vs. Or the diſtinction betweene them may be giuen thus: <hi>A ſacrifice</hi> is a woork, in which we yeeld ſome obedience and worſhip vnto God. But <hi>a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is a work, in which GOD giueth ſomewhat vnto vs: Firſt, <hi>outward ſignes;</hi> Secondly, <hi>Thinges ſignified by them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſame thinges may bee ſacrifices and ſacramentes.</note> A ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and a ſacrifice may be ſometimes together in one and the ſelfe-ſame thing: but they are ſacramentes in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of God, in reſpect of vs ſacrifices, and thoſe onely eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical and of thanks-giuing. For there is but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice propitiatorie by the raunſome of Chriſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs on the croſſe. Obiection. <hi>The Paſſouer and other ceremonies of the oulde teſtament were both ſacrifices and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Therefore ſacramentes doe nothing differ from ſacrifices.</hi> Aunſwere. More is in the concluſion, than in the premiſſes. Becauſe this onely followeth; That the ſame thing may be a ſacrament &amp; a ſacrifice. So Baptiſm, &amp; the Lords Supper are ſacraments, &amp; ſacrifices: They are ſacraments and that principally; becauſe they are the worke of god, who giueth vs ſome thing in them, and dooth therein teſtifie his gift vnto vs. For in them he reacheth vnto vs certaine Symbols and tokens by his miniſters, as alſo by his miniſters hee ſpeaketh by his mouth vnto vs: according as it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth mee.</hi> So therefore euerie miniſter reacheth with his hand the ſacramentes vnto vs, and wee receiue them at their handes, as at the handes of
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:19538:359"/>
God, if ſo wee take them with reuerence: but much more God giueth, and as it were reacheth with his hande vnto vs, in the lawful and right vſe of the ſacramentes, the things themſelues which are ſignified by the ſacramentes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, Baptiſme and the Lordes Supper are ſacrifices, not indeede principally, but as they are our woork, which we perform to God; that is, as we receiue theſe ſignes, as it were from the hand of God, and ſo declare our obedience towards God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE foundation or matter in the Sacraments</hi> are the rites &amp; ceremonies or externall viſible actions inſtituted by God, which are perfourmed by men after a certaine &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne maner, &amp; are called by a relatiue or reſpectiue name ſignes or ſacraments. <hi>The terme</hi> reſpected or correlatiue, is Chriſt &amp; al his benefits, or the internal ſpiritual working of God in vs according to the promiſe of the goſpell: this is called the thing ſigned or ſignified by the ſacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſignified and confirmed by the outward rite. <hi>The relation</hi> it ſelfe that is betweene theſe, (which maketh both to become relatiues, or reſpectiues, being in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abſolute thinges,) is the order inſtituted by God, the ſignifieng of a ſpirituall thing by a corporall thing, and the ſealing of the thing ſignified. <hi>The correlatiues</hi> are the things ſignified and the ſignes. Heereby now appeareth that this coniunction of thinges with their ſignes, or ſacramentall vnion, is not corporall or local. <hi>Nowe this vnion conſiſteth in two things.</hi> 1. <hi>Jn a ſimilitude and proportion of the ſignes with the thinges ſignified.</hi> 2. <hi>In the ioint-exhibiting or receiuing of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> thinges, and in the lawfull and right vſe.</hi> The faithful onely, in the lawful and right vſe, receiue the ſigns of the miniſters, and the things ſignified of Chriſt: and when we ſo receiue both, that is the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, the ſame is called <hi>ſacramental vnion.</hi> For in theſe it conſiſteth, and not in a preſence of the thing and the ſigne in one and the ſame place, and much leſſe in any transmut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sacramentall vnion</hi> therefore <hi>is ſuch,</hi> as agreeth to all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and ſuch as was the vnion of Chriſt with the ould ſacraments, ſuch is it alſo now. <hi>A ſacrament,</hi> is a reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue or relatiue word. <hi>The foundation</hi> we ſaid to bee a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony inſtituted by GOD: Chriſt or the communion of Chriſt and al his benefits, are <hi>the terme. The relation</hi> is the
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:19538:361"/>
ordination of that rite or ceremony to the thing ſignified, that is, both Chriſt himſelfe, &amp; his benefits, or the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and participation of chriſt and his benefits. For <hi>in euery ſacrament are theſe two, the thing ſignified, and the ſignes.</hi> Now the thing and the ſacrament differ, as the relatiue, and the correlatiue. As therefore the things cannot be without the ſigne: ſo if you take away the ſigne from the thing, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more a ſigne, becauſe the relation conſiſteth in the ioining of things: As the maſter is no more a maſter, if he haue no ſeruaunt. Wherefore the thinges and their ſignes are diſtinguiſhed, but not ſundered and ſeparated. <hi>Briefer thus: Jn euery ſacrament are the ſigne and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. The thing</hi> is chriſt himſelfe and his benefits, or the communion and participation of chriſt and his benefites. <hi>The thing and the ſacrament differ in this. The thing</hi> is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the ſacrament, neither are the ſignes ſacramentes. The ſigne is not the thing: but if you take away the ſigne, the thing remaineth no longer, neither the ſigne, if you take away the thing. Therefore they are to be diſcerned, not to be ſundered. Wherefore theſe two muſt be together, ſo that if one be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaie, the other remaineth no longer that, which before it was ſaid to be. Of all this which hath been ſaid we conclude, <hi>that there is a ſacramentall vnion and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of the things &amp; ſignes in ſacraments; and it conſiſteth,</hi>

For ſome are ſubſiſting forms, ſome accidents, not inherent in the ſacramentall ſignes, but in the mindes of men; as the gifts of the holy ghoſt.

And becauſe we attaine vnto this by faith.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid: <hi>The bread is the communion of the bodie of Chriſt: Baptiſme doth ſaue vs.</hi> Neither yet doth the holy Ghoſt alwaies confirme and eſtabliſh faith by them, as the examples of Simon Magus, and of infinite others doe ſhewe.

                     <p>The confirmation <hi>of the</hi> 16. <hi>concluſion. The ſacraments without the word going before, doe neither teach nor confirme our faith: becauſe the meaning and ſignification of them, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, except it be declared by the woorde, neither can the ſigne confirme anie thing, except the thing bee firſt promiſed.</hi> An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof are the Iewes, who obſerued and nowe doe obſerue the ceremonies, but adioine thereto the not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode promiſe of the grace and benefites of Chriſt. <hi>Without the Word thoſe who are of vnderſtanding are not ſaued,</hi> either by doctrine, as by ordinarie means, or by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and extraordinarie knowledge. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not in the ſonne, is alreadie condemned.</hi> Rom. 3.17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing: and hearing by the woorde of god. But they may bee ſaued without the ſacramentes:</hi> becauſe although by ſome neceſſitie they bee depriued of theſe, yet they may beleeue, as the theefe did on the Croſſe. Or: if they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, according to the condition of their age they are ſanctified, as Iohn in the wombe, and many infants alſo in the wombe, who died before the day of circumciſion. <hi>The Woord alſo is to bee preached vnto the wicked,</hi> becauſe it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to conuert them. <hi>But the ſacraments are to bee admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred vnto them, who are acknowledged for members of the church;</hi> becauſe they are inſtituted for the vſe of the church

onely. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Thou maieſt be baptized, if thou beleeueſt.</hi>

                     <p>The confirmation <hi>of the eighteenth concluſion.</hi> The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof is manifeſt <hi>by the Paſſeouer, and other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as alſo by the ſabboth: which all were commaunded by God,</hi> that the godly might celebrate and worſhip God, and ſhew themſelues gratefull vnto him, and might withall take the ſignes and tokens of thoſe benefits of God, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the Meſſias. So Baptiſme is a confeſſion of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and a ſigne, whereby Chriſt teſtifieth that wee are waſhed by his bloode. The ſupper of the Lord is a thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for the death of Chriſt, and an aduertiſement that we are quickened &amp; reuiued by his death, &amp; are made his members, &amp; ſhall remaine &amp; continue with him for euer.</p>

                  <p>THE confirmation of the Definition and chief ends of Baptiſme is conteined in the woordes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which are read in S. Matthew and S.

He that ſhall beleeue, and ſhall be baptized, ſhal be ſaued: but he that wil not beleeue, ſhall be damned.</hi> Theſe are briefly to be expounded and declared, <hi>Teach all.</hi> Teach all, and not ſome nations, neither Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams poſteritie onely. Here is <hi>the difference of the ſacraments of the old and new Teſtament.</hi> For Chriſt did not inſtitute this new ſacrament for the Iewes onely, to whom properly did belong the old ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: but to all others alſo ſucceeding. <hi>Baptiſing them.</hi> That is, all, who by your doctrine come vnto me, &amp; are made my Diſciples. And among them are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Infants alſo of ſuch as come vnto Chriſt, or are Chriſtes Diſciples: For their Infants alſo are Diſciples, as being borne in the ſchoole of Chriſt. For to bee borne in the Church, ſerueth to the Infants inſteede of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.<note place="margin">The woord is to go before the Sacramentes.</note> The order here is to be noted and obſerued. Hee willeth firſt, that they <hi>be taught,</hi> and after, that they <hi>be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</hi> Wherefore hee will not haue the ſacraments to bee dumbe, but ſignifieth that the woord ought to goe before, and then the ſacraments to follow. <hi>In the name of the Father, and the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt.</hi> Theſe wordes, <hi>Jn the name,</hi> ſignifie 1. <hi>That Baptiſme was inſtituted by the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and autoritie of theſe three;</hi> and that theſe three perſons doe command, that they who will bee members of the Church, be baptiſed. Wherefore it is of like force, when the Miniſter baptiſeth, as if God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt did baptiſe. And hereof alſo it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that theſe three perſons, are the three <hi>ſubſiſtentes,</hi> or perſons of the Godhead. 2. They ſignifie, <hi>that theſe three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons confirme vnto vs by their owne teſtification, that they receiue vs into fauour, and performe that vnto vs which is ſignified by baptiſme:</hi> which is, ſaluation, if we beleeue, and be baptiſed: Where is noted the ſecond ende of baptiſme. 3. <hi>To be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the name of the Father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="723" facs="tcp:19538:370"/>
trust, honor, and inuocation of this true god who is the Father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt.</hi> This is the third ende of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which Paul alſo in theſe wordes declareth; <hi>Were yee baptiſed into the name of Paul?</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay; Ye ought to bee his, to whom ye haue giuen your name, and bound your ſelues in Baptiſme. 4. <hi>Baptiſing them in the name of the Father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt, that is, Baptiſing them by inuocation of the three perſons, inuocating the name of the father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt vpon them:</hi> Which three perſons receiue vs into fauour: And the Father verily receiueth vs into fauour, for the ſonne, by the holy Ghoſt, whome the ſonne giueth vs from the Father. <hi>Hee that ſhall beleeue.</hi> This is added vnto the promiſe. For they who are Baptiſed, can not receiue that which is promiſed and ſealed in Baptiſme, but by faith. And in theſe wordes is noted briefly <hi>the right vſe of Baptiſme,</hi> in which right vſe the ſacraments are ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in whatſoeuer corrupt and vnlawfull vſe and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, the ſacraments are no ſacraments; but are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to them onely who receiue them with a true faith. <hi>And ſhall bee baptized.</hi> Hee woulde confirme vs alſo by the outwarde ſigne: and therefore this is added, <hi>&amp; ſhall be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,</hi> that wee may know that not onely by faith, but by the outward ſigne alſo we are aſſured, that wee are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them who ſhall bee ſaued. Vnto both, <hi>both vnto Faith and vnto baptiſme, the promiſe is adioyned, but after a diuerſe manner: vnto faith,</hi> becauſe it is the onely inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the merit of chriſt is apprehended: <hi>vnto Baptiſme,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſigne and token of this benefit. <hi>Hee ſhal be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi> That is, let him, that is baptiſed, know that hee hath, if he beleeue, thoſe benefits, which are ſignified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall rite: namely, that he is iuſtified and regenerated. <hi>Hee that will not beleeue, ſhall be condemned;</hi> that is, although he be baptiſed. The vſe of the ſacrament without faith doth not ſaue: Therefore with faith it doth ſaue. <hi>The want of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not condemne;</hi> yet ſo, as that want of the ſacrament be without contempt. For not the want, but the contempt of the ſacraments condemne, as which can-not poſſibly be where faith is. And hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, that if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert this propoſition, He that ſhall beleeue and be baptiſed ſhall bee ſaued, wee can-not reteine both neceſſarily: Now wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:19538:371"/>
it thus; <hi>Hee that ſhall be ſaued, ſhall beleeue and be baptiſed;</hi> this propoſition is not neceſſarie, becauſe ſome may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which are not baptiſed, but none can bee ſaued which do not beleeue. Wherefore there is not the ſame neceſſitie of faith, and the ſacraments: The ſacraments are then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, when they may bee had according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and inſtitution of God. For the contempt of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when it may ſo be had, is repugnant vnto faith. Obiection. <hi>Chriſt attributeth ſaluation both to faith, and to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Therefore in conuerting the propoſition, wee muſt affirme both of it, and ſo affirme of him that is to be ſaued, that hee is alſo to beleeue and to bee baptiſed.</hi> Aunſwere. Chriſt attributeth ſaluation to both, but not to both alike: to faith as the mean, to Baptiſm, as the ſigne whereby ſaluation is ſealed vnto vs.</p>

Wee might, for inſtance, oppoſe vnto them the example of circumciſion, which was giuen to Infants who could not yet beleeue. It is true therefore of thoſe, who are of vnderſtanding, that of them none are to bee baptized, but ſuch as beleeue. Neither yet are they
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:19538:373"/>
able to pronounce of thoſe, who are of vnderſtanding, that they doe beleeue. Wherefore if Infants are not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, becauſe they haue not faith; neither are they then, who are of age &amp; vnderſtanding, to bee baptized, of whom it cannot be knowen whether they doe beleeue or no. As, Simon Magus was baptized, and yet was an hypocrite. <hi>But</hi> ſay they, <hi>Profeſſion of faith is ſufficient for the Church.</hi> Wee confeſſe that this is true, and we adde further, that to bee borne in the Church, is vnto infants in ſteede and in place of profeſſion. 2.

We deny their Minor propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which denieth that Infants doe beleeue: <hi>For Jnfants doe beleeue after their manner,</hi> that is, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their age, whereby they haue an inclination to beleeue, or doe beleeue by inclination. For faith is in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants potentiallie and by inclination, albeit faith bee not in them actuallie, as in thoſe, who are of age and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And as wicked Infants, which are without the Church, haue not actual impietie and wickednes, ſo godly Infants, which are in the Church, haue not actual piety, &amp; godlines, but an inclination only to godlines. Furdermore, Infants alſo haue the holy Ghoſt, and are regenerated by him, as was Iohn when as yet he was in the womb.

                  <p>THE ſupper differeth from baptiſme, 1. <hi>Jn ceremonies or rites.</hi> 2. <hi>In the circumſtances of the inſtitution and vſe, or in the ſignifications of the ceremonies.</hi> Baptiſme is a ſigne of the couenant entered and made betweene God &amp; the faithfull. The ſupper is a ſigne of the continuing of that couenant. Or, baptiſme is a ſigne of regeneration and of our entrance into the church. The ſupper is a ſigne of their foſtering, abiding, and preſeruation, who are once entered into the church. The new man muſt firſt be borne by the ſpirite of Chriſt, as is a natural man by natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: and the ſigne of his renewing or regeneration is baptiſme. Afterwards, when he is once renewed and borne again, he muſt be foſtered and nouriſhed by the bodie and bloude of Chriſt, the ſigne of which nouriſhing is the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

                     <p>THE verie manner and forme of ſpeaking yeeldeth vs a firme and ſtrong argument: Breade is the bodie of Chriſt: but bread is not in it owne proper ſubſtance his bodie: (for by reaſon hereof haue they inuented conſubſtantiation) therefore it is a figuratiue ſpeeche, euen ſuch a one as is vſual vnto ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is declared in the inſtitution.</p>

<pb n="750" facs="tcp:19538:384"/>
Therefore neither is anie ſuch thing confirmed by the ſacrament.</p>

                        <hi>3</hi> In all ſacraments, when the names or properties of the things are attributed vnto the ſignes, there is not ſignified the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preſence of the thing, but firſt, a ſimilitude of the things with their ſignes, then a coniunction and vnion of the things with their ſignes in the right vſe: but in this ſacrament Chriſt attributeth the name of the thing, which is his bodie, to the ſigne: therefore there is not thereby ſignified a corporal preſence of his bodie.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>4</hi> The communion of Chriſt, which is promiſed in his woorde and ſacraments, is not corporal: but the communion of Chriſt, which is giuen in the ſupper, is the ſame with that which is giuen in the word and in all ſacraments: therefore the communion of Chriſt in the ſupper is ſpiritual.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <hi>5</hi> There is one and the ſame ſignification of all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old and new teſtament. <hi>This is manifeſt,</hi> becauſe in all the promiſes the ſame benefits are promiſed vnto vs, which are promiſed in the ſacraments. The ſacraments are the viſible woorde; and the ſacraments promiſe the ſame which doth the word. But in the Goſpell is deliuered a communion which is wrought by faith. <hi>That there is the ſame ſignification of the ſacramentes of both Teſtaments, the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1.

For in baptiſme, the thing is the waſhing by the bloud of Chriſt, in the ſupper, the bodie and bloud of Chriſt. <hi>Aunſwere.

But the manner of ſignifiyng one and the ſme thing is diuers, that is, there is a diuers ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of one and the ſame thing ſignified by the ſignes, or, one and the ſame thing hath a diuers ſimilitude or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

For the ſacraments teſtifie of thoſe bleſſings onelie, and them onlie doe they ſeale vnto vs, which are conteined in the promiſe of the Goſpel. Therefore no place is left for a ſubſtantial preſence of the bodie in the bread, as being altogether fruitles and vnprofitable.</p>

Firſt, this is a begging of that which is in queſtion. For they take as graunted, that the bread is properly called the bodie, which yet lieth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to prooue. For it is a ſacramental maner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Secondly, we returne their own reaſon vpon them by inuerting it thus. The bodie of Chriſt properly ſo called was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs. But the bread was not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs: Therfore the bread is not the body properly ſo called.

I denie the Maior, and inuert the reaſon: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee would inſtitute a ſacrament, therefore hee ſpake figuratiuely, calling his Supper the new Teſtament; which is figuratiuely to be vnderſtoode for theſe two reaſons. 1. Becauſe otherwiſe there ſhould be two couenants, the one proper, and the other the ſupper. 2. Otherwiſe alſo they ſhould be ſhut out from Gods couenant, who cannot come to the ſupper, and all who came to the ſupper ſhould be in the couenant. Obiection. <hi>Chriſt ſaith, In my bloud. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the real bloud of chriſt is in the ſupper, and is drunke by the mouth.</hi> Aunſwere. Wee conclude the contrarie rather by thoſe woordes of Chriſt. Becauſe the newe teſtament was made by Chriſts bloud ſhed on the Croſſe and applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by faith, not drunke by the mouth: for otherwiſe they ſhoulde bee excluded from the teſtament and couenaunt, who were not able to come to this ſacrament.

If they adde, Therefore doone by the mouth of the bodie: they bring in more in the concluſion, than was in the antecedent. For there was no type in the olde teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which did ſignifie the eating of Chriſt with the mouth. 2. We inuert their reaſon. Chriſts bodie was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe eaten in the new teſtament, than in the olde: But in the old it was eaten ſpirituallie onely: Therefore in the new alſo it is ſo eaten. Reply. <hi>The newe teſtament differeth from the olde, becauſe in that were types, in the newe is the bodie it ſelfe,</hi> Heb. 9. Col. 2. Aunſwere. This difference of the old and new teſtament is no where ſet downe in holy ſcripture that Chriſt is eaten in the old not really, and in the newe corporally by the mouth. In the places which are allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the Apoſtle, the bodie ſignifieth that the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was onely of the old teſtament and was accompliſhed and fulfilled by Chriſt. Becauſe there the bodie is oppoſed to thoſe ſhadowes: and further becauſe he calleth it <hi>the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of chriſt:</hi> which kinde of ſpeech ſheweth that by Chriſt was wrought the accompliſhment &amp; fulfilling of the types

Matthew, as Theophylact calculateth, writ his goſpel eight yeares after chriſts aſſenſion: Marke, ten yeares: Luke, fifteene yeares: Paul, twentie yeares. And all vſe the ſame words. A ſpeech that is often vttered with the ſame wordes is not figuratiue. Such is the ſpeech of the Lordes Supper. Therefore it is not figuratiue.</hi> Anſwere. It is falſe that a ſpeech often vttered in the ſame words is not figuratiue: becauſe when a figure is conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, knowen, and forcible, as this, it is reteined. Againe, the Euangeliſts repeat the woordes of Chriſt, becauſe hee ſpake figuratiuely. Often, though it bee figuratiue, is this repeated: <hi>He ſhal baptize with the holie Ghoſt and with fier.</hi> Ioh. 1. Matth. 3. Moreouer we denie that this ſpeech of Chriſts Supper was repeated by all in the ſame wordes. 1. Becauſe Matthew and Mark ſay, <hi>This is my bloud of the new teſtament.</hi> Luke ſaith, <hi>This cup is the new teſtament in my bloud.</hi> 2. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Marke ſay, <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> Luke addeth, <hi>which is giuen for you:</hi> Paul, <hi>which is broken for you.</hi> 3. Paul ſaith, <hi>That the bread is the communion of the bodie of Chriſt.</hi> And albeit in this place hee ſpeaketh not purpoſedly of the Supper, yet hee ſtirreth vp and exhorteth vnto it. Replie. <hi>Jt is the ſame ſenſe and meaning.</hi> Aunſwere. The queſtion is not now of the ſenſe and meaning of the woordes, but of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentitie of the wordes, that is, whether they bee the ſame wordes. Replie. <hi>Where there is no mention at all of anie figure, there is no figure.</hi> Anſwere. This is falſe. For fooliſh were it, and men ſhoulde ſeeme to make ſhewe and oſtentation of their skill and art, if they ſhould ſay that they vſed a trim fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. And the ſcripture alſo often ſpeaketh figuratiuely, and yet doth it not ad withall that it ſpeaketh figuratiuely. Furthermore, they make mention hereof, when they ſhew, that it conſiſteth of the nature of the ſubiect and the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. The bodie was borne of the Virgin, crucified, and ſo forth. The bread is made of meale. Secondly, Chriſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>this to bee done in remembraunce of him:</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:19538:400"/>
breade is called his bodie, as a memoriall of his bodie. Thirdly Matthew and Marke ſay, <hi>This is my bloud of the newe teſtament.</hi> Paul and Luke ſay, <hi>This is the newe teſtament in my bloud.</hi> Now the newe teſtament is the bond whereby God hath bound himſelfe to receiue the faithful and repentant into fauour, and they binde themſelues to yeelde faith and obedience vnto him. Fourthly, Paul ſaith, <hi>That the bread is the communion of Chriſts bodie,</hi> which is not any corporal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 1. Becauſe the faithful are thereby one bodie in chriſt. 2. Becauſe he compareth it with the <hi>Communion</hi> of the altar in the old teſtament, which was not corporal. 3. Becauſe it can agree but to the faithful onely, and not to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. 4. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſheweth that communion: <hi>If we walke in the light we haue fellowſhip one with another, and the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne cleanſeth vs from all ſinne.</hi> And further this <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> whereof ſaint Paul ſpeaketh, is our vnion with Chriſt, and fruition of all his benefites by faith. Hither belongeth the ſimilitude of the bodie and the members, the vine and the braunches; which haue nothing to doe with any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral eating. This <hi>communion</hi> was and is common to all the faithful from the beginning vnto the worlds end. But they could not eat the body of chriſt corporally by their mouth. <hi>That wee might growe vp vnto him, by whom all the bodie is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and knit together. He that is ioined vnto the Lord, is one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. And by one ſpirite are we all baptized into one bodie. Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, and he in vs; becauſe he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs of his ſpirite.</hi> This vnion therefore is that <hi>communion,</hi> which is wrought by the holy Ghoſt. Wherefore it is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual For bread cannot be this communion but by a figure, as it is a ſigne of it. Replie. <hi>He that is guiltie of the bodie of Chriſt, eateth it. They who receiue vnworthilie are guiltie of the bodie of Chriſt. Therefore they eate it corporallie: for ſpirituallie they cannot: becauſe if they coulde ſo eate it, they ſhoulde not be guiltie.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is falſe For hee is guiltie of Chriſtes bodie who by his ſinnes hangeth it on the Croſſe againe, and deſpiſeth Chriſts benefite. For any real eating is not required to this guilt, but hee that will not receiue Chriſt offered by faith, is thereby made guiltie. So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie done vnto the Arke, is ſaid to be done vnto the Lord. Replie. <hi>They that diſcerne not the Lords bodie, eate it. But the
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:19538:400"/>
guiltie diſcerne it not; Therefore they eate it.</hi> Aunſwere. If the Maior bee taken ſacramentally, as of the breade, which is called and is the bodie of Chriſt, it is true: but if properly, it is falſe. For, <hi>not to diſcerne his body,</hi> is not to giue due honor to it, to contemne it, yea not to receiue the thing ſignified So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>They are ſaid to treade vnder foote the ſonne of God, and to count the bloud of the teſtament as an vnholie thing,</hi> who contemne him.</p>

Now the opinion of Vbiquitie, and of the reall communicating of the properties of both natures doth raiſe againe from Hel that phantaſticall dotarie and frenſie of thoſe heretiques. Therefore it is no leſſe to bee abandoned and baniſhed out of the church to Hell, than that hereſie of the Manichees.</hi> That this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Vbiquitie doth giue life againe to the former, wee

proue. The Vbiquitaries are of opinion, and ſo teach, That all the properties of the Godhead were preſently, from the verie point of Chriſts conception, reallie effuſed from the Godhead of the woorde into the humane nature which chriſt tooke. Hence theſe abſurdities will folow. 1. <hi>Chriſt ſhall not be truely borne of the Virgine, if as touching the nature of his humanitie he was truely and eſſentiallie without the wombe of his mother before hee was borne; and after hee was borne hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained no leſſe truely and ſubſtantiallie, as touching his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in that ſelfe-ſame wombe, than before.</hi> 2. <hi>Chriſt was not truely weake in his humane nature and ſubiect to paſſions, if hee were then alſo as touching the ſame nature partaker of the Diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and omnipotencie.</hi> 3. <hi>Hee was not truely dead, if alſo in the time of his death, as touching his ſoule and bodie, hee were eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie preſent euerie where together with his Godhead.</hi> For the ſoul being euerie where preſent could not be really ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in diſtance of places from the bodie, which alſo ſhould be euerie where preſent, and ſo neither could the body die, but onely in outward appearance and imagination. 4. <hi>Hee aſcended not truely into heauen: but it ſhall be ſaide to haue beene onely a vaine and imaginarie, and phantaſticall ſpectacle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee were in his bodie ſubſtantiallie there, before hee viſiblie aſcended thither: and after he was aſcended thither, he remained yet, in the ſubſtantiall preſence of the ſame bodie, no leſſe truely, than before, on the earth, yea and in the verie bodies alſo of the faithfull.</hi> If theſe thinges ſo fel out in the truth of the thing; it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the ſame bodie of Chriſt was indeede at once and together both weake and omnipotent, baſe and glorious, ſubiect to ſufferinges, and not ſubiect, dead and aliue, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vnlimited; which is horrible to affirme For auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therefore of theſe prodigious and impious abſurdities they will except, <hi>that he was not as touching his body, otherwiſe than limited, weak, ſubiect to paſſions, and mortal, in the time of his humiliation: becauſe he had debaſed himſelfe, and would not ſhew forth that maieſtie, communicated vnto his bodie before his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Aunſwere.

                           <p>THE blaſphemie of Samoſatenus, Arrius, &amp; the late Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitaries, is this: That Chriſt, man, is not properlie and by nature God, but onlie by an accidental participation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine properties, maieſtie, honour, power, and vertue. The Vbiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alſo maintaine the ſame conſideration of the God-heade of Chriſt, man, while they define the perſonall vnion by his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating alone of properties, whereby the fleſh of Chriſt is made om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and euerie where. So that now that man is, and is called God, not that he is properlie &amp; by nature God, but becauſe infinit power, maieſtie, and glorie is giuen him from God, and all the gifts of the holie Ghoſt are beſtowed on him without meaſure. Now this accidentall beſtowing of the Godhead and all the properties, doth not make chriſt to be properlie and by nature God, but onelie by diuine grace, or God vnproperlie ſo called: Becauſe it is not the verie eſſential God-head of the Word, but a certaine participation thereof, in vertue and eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſelfe ſame alſo doe the Vbiquitaries teach, becauſe they crie that there is no difference betweene the inhabiting and dwelling of the God-head in Peter, and in Chriſt, except it bee taken from the communication of the giftes or properties of the God-heade. And they contend that by this means this man, which was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Word, is God, becauſe the Word doth nothing without him, but al things by him.

                  <p>THE power of the keies is neceſſary, 1. <hi>In reſpect of the commandement: If hee refuſe to heare the Church, let him bee vnto thee as an heathen man, and a publicane.</hi> And vnto ſuch a one the Lorde will not communicate or impart his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which hee ordained and inſtituted for the faithfull onely. 1. Cor. 5.5. <hi>Let ſuch a one be deliuered vnto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may bee ſaued in the day of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> 1. Cor. 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread and drinke of this cup.</hi> And ſeeing Chriſt doth not inſtitute his ſacramentes but for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;

therefore <hi>neither can wee bee partakers of the table of the Lord, and of Diuels. For what concord hath chriſt with Belial?</hi> But all thoſe that profeſſe corrupt doctrine, and perſiſt in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, are at the table of Diuels. Chriſt therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, Matt. 5.24. <hi>That thou leaue thine offering before the altar, and goe thy way, and firſt bee reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> Wherefore he will haue them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them-ſelues firſt vnto God, according to all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes, before they approch to any ſacrament For by the name of <hi>Altar</hi> here are vnderſtoode any ſacraments whatſoeuer. <hi>Num.</hi> 15.31. It is ſaide: <hi>Becauſe hee hath deſpiſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commaundement; that perſon ſhall be vtterlie cut off.</hi> And Deut. 17.12. <hi>That man that will doe preſumptuouſlie, not hearkening vnto the Prieſt (that ſtandeth before the Lord thy God to miniſter there) or vnto the Iudge, that man ſhall die, and thou ſhalt take away euil from Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> By theſe two places God will haue thoſe cut off which are rebellious againſt this law, and that euen from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſtate and common wealth; neither doth he permit them to be anie members of his people: much leſſe then will he haue them to be accounted members of his viſible church. The ciuil or iudicial law indeede is taken away, as alſo are the ceremonies: but that eſpecial difference betweene the citizens of the church &amp; others is not taken away. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon chriſt (which place wee alleaged before) <hi>wil haue no man to offer his gift, before he be reconciled vnto his brother;</hi> and ſo doth hee manifeſtly declare that hee will not that they, who repent not, lay hands on thoſe ſacraments, which are appropriated to the penitent and beleeuers only: whereby withall hee putteth a great difference betweene beleeuers and vnbeleeuers, the obſtinate, and repentaunt. So Peter alſo beholding the hypocriſie and impietie of Simon the Sorcerer, dooth openly diſtinguiſh and part him from the faithful, denouncing <hi>that he hath neither part nor fellowſhip in this buſines,</hi> that is, in the doctrine of the goſpel, which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught. 2. The power of the keies is neceſſarie, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of gods glorie.</hi> For God is reproched and deſpited, if without difference the wicked and blaſphemers goe in the number of his children. 3. It is neceſſarie, <hi>leaſt the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be prophaned,</hi> and that bee giuen to the wicked in the

It is neceſſary, <hi>For the ſafetie of the Church,</hi> which ſhall be puniſhed if ſhee wittingly &amp; willingly prophane Chriſts ſacraments. 5. <hi>For the ſafetie of the ſinners,</hi> that they beeing often admoniſhed may return to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. 6. <hi>For auoiding of offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the church that others bee not corrupted.</hi> 1.

                  <p>It remaineth now that we ſee, <hi>what Excommunication is. Excommunication is the baniſhing of a grieuous tranſgreſſour, or an open, vngodly and obſtinate perſon, from the fellowſhippe of the faithfull, by the iudgement of the Elders, by the conſent of the church, and by the authoritie of chriſt, and by the holy Scripture:</hi> When the Church therefore pronounceth of any, that they are not godly, they muſt be excommunicated, and not admitted vnto the ſacrament.

<pb n="800" facs="tcp:19538:409"/>
who although he profeſſe himſelf in word to be a chriſtian, yet in deedes ſheweth the contrary. And this <hi>denunciation, whereby one is excommunicated, is not in the power of the miniſter of the Church, but in the power of the Church, and is doone in the name of the Church,</hi> becauſe this commandement was giuen by chriſt vnto the church.

Neither ought this denunciation of the church to be vſed without effect, for, (as was before ſaide) of whome the church denounceth that they are not godly, the church is bound to excommunicate them, and not admitte them to the vſe of the Sacramentes. <hi>Now who are to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, is knowen ſufficientlie by that which hath beene ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; namelie ſuch, as either deny ſome article of faith, or ſhewe that they wil not repent, or ſubmitte not them-ſelues to the will of God, according to his commandements, neither make any doubt of perſiſting ſtubbornly in manifeſt wickedneſſe.</hi> Al ſuch are not to be admitted into the Church. or, if they haue beene admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church in Baptiſme, yet we muſt not goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in offering them the Lordes ſacred Supper: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, ſuch as profeſſe faith and repentance, the church is bound to admitte.

Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome bee it ſpoken): becauſe it is witneſſed by their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that their lawes were taken from them by Herode the Greate; and Ioſephus writeth that the whole councell was put to death by him, one onely excepted. Therefore the Iewes in effect ſay this: Thou haſt the power of the ſworde; it is not lawful for vs to put any man to death. Reply, <hi>It is ſaid in the Goſpell; Take yee him and iudge him after your owne Law.</hi> Aunſwere. He meaneth the Law of Moſes: which was, That he ſhould be ſtoned to death, Pilate graunting them the libertie of vſing their owne Law.

Moreouer Claudius is ſaid in this ſenſe to haue graunted them their Lawes, becauſe hee permitted them to obſerue their owne Lawes and rites in religion. Replie. <hi>Their councell was taken awaie by Herode the Great: Therefore before time they had ciuill iuriſdiction, and at that time, when Chriſt commaunded to ſignifie it vnto the councel. Wherefore, by conſequent, it was to be ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ciuil ſenate: for there was no other councel but the ciuill. There were in al three councels or aſſemblies,</hi> 1. <hi>Of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as the high court of parliament in England.</hi> 2. <hi>A leſſe councel, which was the ſenate of the citie of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; that was both ciuil &amp; eccleſiaſtical.</hi> 3. <hi>The Triumuiri. Al theſe were ciuil. The councel then was ciuill. Chriſt ſendeth to the councel. Therefore to the ciuil ſenate.</hi> Anſ. The councel was ciuil, but not only ciuil: for it had alſo eccleſiaſtical power, becauſe it handled &amp; decided matters of religion: It conſiſted of Phariſees &amp; Scribes, of Diuines &amp; Lawyers. For they had morall &amp; iudicial Lawes.</p>
                     <p>Now then the queſtion is, <hi>Whether Chriſt commaundeth to tel the councel, as it is ciuill: or as it is eccleſiaſtical.</hi> That hee wil haue it ſignified vnto the councel, as it is Eccleſiaſtical, we proue out of the text. 1. <hi>Becauſe wee are commaunded to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the excommunicated perſon for an heathen man and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi> that is, for an aliene from Chriſtes kingdome.

<pb n="808" facs="tcp:19538:413"/>
not vnto the ciuil: becauſe a Publican and an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then may be a member of the cittie, but not of the church of Chriſt. 2. Chriſt addeth, <hi>Verily, verily, J ſaie vnto you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer yee bind on earth, ſhal be bound in heauen.</hi> Heere Chriſt meeteth with an obiection: For the excommuned perſon may obiect; what doth this touch me? Although the church account me for an infidel, for an Heathen and Publicane, I wil notwithſtanding in the meane ſeaſon eate and drink. Chriſt anſwereth therefore, That this iudgement ſhall not be fruſtrate or of no effect: for I may ſelfe wil be the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of it. Before, in the 16 Chapter, he ſaid, <hi>I will giue thee the keies of the kingdome of heauen:</hi> but there hee ſpeaketh of the common and general authority of the miniſterie: here he ſpeaketh namely and particularly of the miniſters au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this cauſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Reply. <hi>Satisfaction is perfect obedience: we are not bound to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: Therefore neither are we bound to perfect obedience, no not in the life to come. For, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another hath ſatisfied for, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is not enforced to ſatisfie. But the obedience of Chriſt is not a ful ſatisfaction for our ſinnes. Therefore the fomer conſequence is true.</hi> Aunſwere. There is yet more concluded than the premiſſes would afford: For this ſhould followe, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is neuer at any time to bee performed of vs, as thereby to ſatisfie for our ſins already co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, or which ſhall be committed vntill the end of our life. But it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not hereof, that wee muſt not bee perfect in the life to come. For then alſo wee ſhall bee bound to perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; we ſhall be like vnto the Angels, and our worke ſhall
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:19538:427"/>
be perfectly good; although that perfect obedience, then due, neither ſhall, nor can be a ſatisfaction, or ranſome for our ſinnes, to wit, for that obedience which we omitted in this life, and yet was due to be performed of vs. For he that oweth twenty florens, doth not pay his debt if he repay ten florens. Wherefore the Maior propoſition hath a double meaning, and is true, if it be taken in this ſenſe: whom an other hath ſatisfied for, hee himſelfe is not bound to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, to wit, for thoſe thinges, for which ſatisfaction was made before. So we are not bound to ſatisfie for our ſinnes, which we now commit. For Chriſt hath fully &amp; perfectly ſatisfied his Father for all our ſinnes, and hath performed perfect obedience vnto the Lawe in our behalfe, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wee ſhoulde haue performed in this life vnto the lawe, and which we in this life omit, and are no way able to perfourme. Now for this end hath Chriſt ſatisfied for vs, and redeemed vs by his bloud, that at length we might in the life to come ceaſe from ſinne, and performe that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto him, which then we are to performe. Neither dooth it for all this hereof followe, that God requireth a double obedience or ſatisfaction of vs. For God excteth obedience hence-forward of vs, as thereby to ſhewe our thankefulneſſe, and not to ſatisfie for thoſe ſins which we commit in this life. For wee are neuer able to ſatisfie by that obedience, which we owe, for that obedience, which we doe not performe: neither is there any other beſides Chriſts ſatisfaction required for that obedience which is not performed by vs in this life: &amp; this ſatisfaction of chriſt is ſufficient to expiate and doe away all our ſinnes, God notwithſtanding doth in this life alſo require of vs this our obedience, though yet it be but begun and vnperfect. For ſeeing God ſo greatly hated ſinne, that ſatisfaction could not be made vnto him for ſinne, but by the death of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne; wee verily muſt alſo hate it; euen as himſelfe alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth vs to fly &amp; abhor it from our hart and ſoule. And Chriſt hath not therefore freely redeemed vs, that it might hence forwarde be lawful for vs to giue our ſelues ouer vnto ſinne, but <hi>that being freed from ſinne wee ſhould hereafter begin to liue to him onely.</hi> This end of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which Chriſt himſelfe reſpected, is cauſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:19538:427"/>
for which al of vs ſhould neceſſarily doe good workes; becauſe namelie they are teſtimonies and effectes of that new life which is at length after this life to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this cauſe, there are manie others alſo in like ſort moſt weightie, which we wil in few words declare. <hi>We are to doe good woorkes, in reſpect of God, our ſelues, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> In reſpect of God, 1. <hi>Becauſe of the commandement of God; Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they maie ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen.</hi> God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the beginning of obedience in this life, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof in the life to come. Wherefore we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie to giue our ſelues to good workes, that wee maie perfourme due obedience vnto God, who requireth it of vs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15·12. <hi>This is my commaundement, that yee loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Rom. 6.18. <hi>Beeing made free from ſinne, yee are made the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of righteouſnes.</hi> 1.

<pb n="838" facs="tcp:19538:428"/>
when as therefore we find not in our ſelues good works or newe obedience, we are hypocrites, neither haue we faith, but an euil conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For true faith only (which neuer wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth al her fruites) bringeth foorth, as a fruitful tree, good woorkes, obedience, amendment of life: and theſe fruites likewiſe diſcerne and diſtinguiſh true faith from hiſtorical, and temporary faith, and ſo alſo from hypocriſie. 2. <hi>That we maie be aſſured that we haue obtained remiſſion of ſinnes through Chriſt; and are for Chriſtes ſake iuſtified before God,</hi> for iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſanctification are benefites linked together, which ſo cleaue together, and that neceſſarily, as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can be ſeuered or pulled aſunder.

And that we haue faith, wee perceiue by the woorkes of faith, true obedience and true conuerſion. 4. <hi>That by good woorkes our faith maie bee exerciſed, cheriſhed, ſtrengthned, and aduaunced.</hi> For they who giue themſelues ouer to corrupt luſts againſt their conſcience, in them faith cannot be, and therefore neither a good conſcience, neither a confidence and truſt in god as beeing appeaſed and fauourable vnto them. For wee haue through faith onelie a feeling of gods fauor towards vs, &amp; a good conſcience. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Jf yee liue after the fleſh, yee ſhal die.</hi> 2.

                     <hi>Eccleſiaſtical or ceremonial Laws</hi> are thoſe which are made by the conſent of the church concerning ſome certaine order of actions to be obſerued in the miniſterie of the church, which are the limitations of circumſtances ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the Law of god.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diuine Lawes,</hi> that is, the Lawes of God, partly belong vnto Angels, and partly vnto men. And theſe do not only binde vnto external actions, but require furder internal or inward qualities, actions, and motions; nether propoſe they corporal and temporal rewards and puniſhments only, but eternall alſo and ſpiritual; and they are the ends for which humane Lawes are to bee made. Diuine Lawes, are ſome external and vnchangeable, ſome changeable, yet ſo that they can bee chaunged of none but of god himſelfe, who made them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By the Law alſo is often-times vnderſtood the courſe &amp; order of nature, inſtituted and ardained by god.</hi> So the Law, that is, the order of nature requireth, that a tree bring foorth fruite. After this ſort, is the order of nature vnderſtoode by the Lawe abuſiuely: but yet more abuſiuely dooth the Apoſtle call Originall ſinne, <hi>the Lawe of ſinne;</hi> becauſe namelie it doth in maner of a Lawe enforce and conſtraine vs to ſin.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing humane Lawes, and other things, which are ſignified by the name of Lawe, we will ſpeake hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth <hi>of the Lawe of god,</hi> as which only hath place here, and is the fountaine of all other good Lawes, which are woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the name of Lawes. <hi>The Lawe of god then is, a doctrine deliuered of god at the creation, by the miniſtery either of Angels, or of men, and afterwardes repeated and renued of him by Moſes and the Prophets, teaching what we ought to doe, and what not to doe, binding reaſonable creatures, alwaies promiſing to perfect perfourmers of obedience, eternal life, condemning eternally them who perfourme not this obedience, except remiſſion be graunted for the Mediatours ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The parts of the Law of god, are in number three, The Morall, Ceremonial, and ciuil, or iudiciall Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Morall Lawe is a Doctrine agreeing with the eternall and
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:19538:431"/>
immortall wiſedome and iuſtice which is in god, diſcerning things honeſt and diſhoneſt, knowen by nature and engendred in reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, at the creation, and afterwardes repeated againe and declared by the voice of god, by the miniſterie of Moſes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, teaching that there is a god, and what he is, &amp; what we ought to doe, and what not to doe, binding all the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures to perfect obedience, both internal and external, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing the fauor of god and euerlaſting life to thoſe which perform perfect obedience, and denouncing the wrath of god &amp; euerlaſting pains &amp; puniſhments vnto them who are not perfectlie correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereunto, except there be graunted remiſſion of ſinnes, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the Sonne of god the Mediatours ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That in this part of the Lawe, the nature and righteouſneſſe of god is expreſſed,</hi> the image of god dooth ſhew; whereunto man was created. <hi>For ſeeing this image of god conſiſteth in true righteouſneſſe and holineſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 5. <hi>and that righteouſneſſe &amp; holines is deſcribed &amp; compriſed in the Law.</hi> Deut. 12. Ezech. 20. it followeth then, that this is the image of god, whereunto man ought to be conformed, which is expreſſed in the law. The ſame is taught by manie teſtimonies of Scripture, which affirme that god is delighted with this righteouſnes, which he commaundeth in the Lawe, and that hee dooth ſuch things, as that is, and hateth the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That this law is external,</hi> is hereof apparant and manifeſt, becauſe it remaineth from the beginning vnto the end of the world one and the ſame, &amp; we are redeemed by Chriſt and regenerated by the holie ghoſt, to obſerue and keepe this Law in the life to come. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.7. <hi>J write no new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement vnto you, but an old commaundement, which ye haue had from the beginning.</hi> Galat. 5.20. <hi>They which doe ſuch things, ſhal not inherit the kingdome of god.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Moral Lawes are ſo belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging vnto the Decalogue, that not only they agree with the Decalogue, neither are onlie deduced thence by a neceſſary conſequence, but alſo the Decalogue it ſelfe is the ſumme of the Morall Lawes; whence it commeth to paſſe, that hee who breaketh the Moral Lawes, is ſaid to breake the Decalogue. Neither is this which we haue ſaid hindered at al, <hi>for that certaine ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al commaundementes belonging to matters of this life haue ceaſed.</hi> For the general ſhal notwithſtanding ſtill continue. There
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:19538:432"/>
ſhal be no neede of the miniſterie, or of a certaine time to be alotted vnto the miniſterie in the life to come; becauſe there ſhalbe a perpetual Sabboth, that is, al eternity ſhalbe giuen for the contemplation &amp; beholding of diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; for the worſhip &amp; magnifieng of God. There ſhalbe no neede of Lawes concerning marriage, becauſe there ſhal be no vſe of marriage: but yet there ſhal bee an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique chaſtitie in men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Law is knowen by nature, and from the creation:</hi> becauſe men and Angels were created according to the image of God. And Paul alſo ſaith of the remnauntes of that light, <hi>Roman.</hi> 2.15. <hi>The Gentiles ſhew the effect of the Lawe written in their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This Lawe alſo bindeth the Angels:</hi> becauſe they alſo were created vnto the image of God: and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. <hi>That the Saints in the life to come ſhalbe as the Angels of God:</hi> &amp; he hath taught vs to pray, <hi>Let thy wil be done in earth as it is in heauen. Jt requireth furdermore perfect obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:</hi> Deu. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy ſoule.</hi> Galat. 3.10. <hi>Curſed is euery man that continueth not in al thinges, which are written in the booke of the Law, to doe them.</hi> Now, that the Law dooth not take away the interceſſion of Chriſt, is apparant out of the goſpell, which teacheth that it is correſpondent and agreeable vnto the iuſtice and Lawe of God, that ſinners ſhould be receiued into fauour, a ſufficient ſatisfaction and their conuerſion being interpoſed and comming between. For god is not at variance with himſelfe in the doctrine of the Law and the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Ceremonial, or lawes deliuered of god by Moſes concerning Ceremonies, binding the Iewes vntill the comming of the Meſſias, that they ſhould diſtinguiſh this people &amp; the church from others, and ſhould be ſignes, ſymboles, types, or ſhadowes of ſpirituall thinges to be fulfilled in the New Teſtament by Chriſt.</hi> That this definition may be vnderſtood, we muſt know, <hi>what ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are;</hi> to wit, <hi>ſolemne externall actions,</hi> that is, often to bee after the ſame maner, &amp; with the ſame circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated, <hi>ordained of God, or of men alſo, to be vſed in the ſeruice and woorſhippe of God, for order, or ſignification ſake.</hi> But the Ceremonies which are ordained of God, are ſimple &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely diuine worſhip. The ceremonies which are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:19538:432"/>
and inſtituted of men, if they be good, are a woorſhip onely ſeruing for diuiuine worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Judicial, or Lawes concerning the ciuill order, or ciuil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, that is, of the offices of Magiſtrates, iudgementes, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, contractes, and of the diſtinguiſhing and bounding of dominions, deliuered of God by Moſes for the ſettling and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Jewes common wealth, binding al Abrahams poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vntil the comming of the Meſſias, and furder that they ſhould be the bond of the preſeruation and gouernment of this Moſaicall common wealth vntill the Meſſias was manifeſted, and certaine markes, whereby this people, which was bound vnto them, ſhould be diſcerned from al others, and ſhould withall bee kept in honest diſcipline and good order: laſtlie, that they might be types of that order which ſhould be in Chriſts kingdome, that is, of the ſpiritual regiment of the Meſſias.</hi> Ceremoniall and ciuill Lawes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be diuine, or humane, (ſo that they be good) are verily agreeable vnto the Decalogue. But yet are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thence onely by a neceſſary conſequence, and ſerue thereto, as certaine preſcriptions of circumſtances: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by plainly appeareth the difference of theſe Lawes; which yet is diuerſe, becauſe there is not one and the ſame go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the common-wealth and of the church: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there the ſame end of al theſe Lawes: neither are al theſe Lawes after the ſame maner abrogated.</p>
                  <p>But the chiefe and eſpeciall difference of theſe lawes is drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the binding, time, &amp; knowledge, or manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. 1. <hi>The Moral ordinances are knowen by nature: The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and ciuil are not knowen by nature,</hi> but are inſtituted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuerſity of cauſes, and circumſtaunces. 2. <hi>The Moral bind al men, and euen the Angels alſo: The ceremonial and ciuill were onely preſcribed vnto the people of Iſrael.</hi> And therefore Iob, Iethro, Naaman the Cyrian, and others who are recounted for religious men, that is, ſuch as were borne of Paynims and liued amongeſt them, but yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the God which was manifeſted among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraell; they did not obſerue the Leuiticall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and yet did neuertheleſſe pleaſe God. And the verie ordinaunces themſelues, concerning the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and the forme of ciuill gouernement, ſhewe that they bind Abrahams poſteritie onelie, whom God woulde
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:19538:433"/>
by this fourme of gouernment and worſhippe diſtinguiſh from other nations 3. <hi>The Lawes of the Decalogue are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual in this life, and after this life: The ceremonial and ciuill were deliuered of God at a certaine time, and againe aboliſhed.</hi> 4. <hi>The Moral Lawes ſpeak of both internall and external obedience: The ceremoniall and ciuil ſpeak of externall obedience only: albeit neither doth this pleaſe God without the internall and morall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> 5. <hi>The moral Lawes are not limited by certain circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but are general:</hi> as, that there is a time to bee granted for the miniſtery and ſeruice of God, and that the miniſtery is to be preſerued. that adulterers and theeues are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: <hi>But the ceremonial and ciuil Lawes are ſpecial,</hi> or a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of circumſtances, which are to be obſerued in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rites or actions both eccleſiaſtical and ciuil: as, that the ſeuenth daie is to be alotted for the miniſtery and ſeruice of God: that the Tenths and firſt-fruits are to bee giuen to the Prieſtes: that adulterers are to be ſtoned: that theeues are to be amerced with a four-fold reſtitution. 6. <hi>The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, and the ciuil Lawes alſo are types or figures of other things for whoſe cauſe they were ordained: The moral ſignifie or prefigure nothing, but are ſignified by the rites and ceremonies.</hi> 7. <hi>The morall are the end for which other cauſes are to bee made, or, they are the principal ſeruice and worſhippe of god: The ceremonial and ciuil ſerue for the moral ordinances,</hi> that to them obedience might be rightly and duely perfourmed: that a certain time, and certain rites may be obſerued in the publique miniſtery of the church, that the miniſtery it ſelfe maie bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerued. 8. <hi>The ceremoniall giue place vnto the Morall: The Morall giue not place vnto the Ceremoniall. The Morall Lawe, the Naturall, and the Decalogue differ. The Decalogue</hi> is the ſumme of the morall Lawes, which are ſcattered throughout the whole Scripture of the olde and new Teſtament. <hi>The Naturall lawe</hi> dooth not differ from the Morall in nature not corrupted, but in nature corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: a good part of the natural law is darkened by ſins, and but a little part only concerning the obedience due to god was left remaining after the fall: For which cauſe alſo God hath in his church repeated againe and declared the whole ſentence and doctrine of his Lawe. The diſtinctions of theſe Lawes are to bee knowen, both in reſpect of the
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:19538:433"/>
differences of the ſame, and alſo in reſpect of their aborga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and laſtly for the knowing and vnderſtanding of their vſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE firſt and principall vſe of the ceremoniall and iudiciall Lawes of Moſes was to ſerue as a ſchoolemaſter vnto Chriſt and his kingdome,</hi> that is, to bee a ſignification of ſpirituall and Heauenly things in Chriſts kingdome namely the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of Chriſt towardes his Church, and the duty of the Church towardes God and chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Law was our Schoolmaſter to bring vs vnto Chriſt.</hi> This S. Paul prououn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth of the whole Lawe of Moſes. But that it is true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forme of ceremoniall worſhippe and ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, for a type and ſignification of chriſts kingdome, the Epiſtle to the Hebrues doth purpoſely teach from the beginning of the fourth chapter to the end of the tenth, &amp; all places of Scripture, which referre the ceremonies and kingdome of the old people vnto Chriſt, as <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Wee are circumciſed with circumciſion made without hands.</hi> 1. Cor. 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our paſſeouer is ſacrificed for vs.</hi> Pſal. 110. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for euer.</hi> Dan. 9. <hi>The moſt holy ſhalbe annointed.</hi> And of the ciuill Lawes it is ſaide, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44, 24. <hi>Jn controuerſie ſhall the Prieſt ſtand to iudge, and they ſhall iudge it according to my iudgements.</hi> Ierem 23.5. <hi>Behold, the daies come, ſaith the Lorde, that I will raiſe vnto Dauid a righteous branch, and a king ſhall raign, and proſper, and ſhall execute iudgement, and iuſtice in the earth.</hi> Wherefore that forme of woorſhippe and ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment was ordained of god principally vnto this, that thereby the old people might be aduertiſed of the thinges ſignified and to be performed by the Meſſias. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the allegories or figuratiue ſpeeches of all the Lawes are not in ſpeciall expreſſed and expounded in the woorde of god; Firſt, <hi>we are to make or receiue none, but ſuch as reteineth an analogy with faith and loue:</hi> &amp; againe <hi>theſe onlie are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and held for true and certaine, which can bee prooued by Scripture.</hi> But thoſe which are not declared either by plain expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or by the maners of ſpeaking in the ſcripture, the ſame may be verily tolerated, as orher ſimilitudes which are brought by way of example, but may not be admitted as certain, and as proofes of doctrine. And in thoſe, which
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:19538:434"/>
are not declared in ſpeciall, it is ſufficient to reſt in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſignification.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>by theſe as by viſible markes, and eminent differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God would haue his people, with whom the true worſhip of god and the promiſe of the Meſſias was left, to bee diſcerned and ſorted out from al other nations, &amp; that both for his own glorie,</hi> that the true god and true religion might be diſcerned from Idoles and the inuentions of men; and alſo <hi>for mens ſaluation,</hi> that they ſeeking after the church in the world, might find and behold it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Keepe them therefore and doe them: for that is your wiſedome and your vnderſtanding in the ſight of the people &amp;c.</hi> And chapter 12.30. <hi>Beware that thou aske not after their gods, ſaieng, How did theſe nations ſerue their gods, that I may do ſo likewiſe? Thou ſhalt not doe ſo vnto to the Lord thy God: for all abomination, which the Lorde hateth, haue they done vnto their gods.</hi> Eph. 2.14. <hi>Which hath made of both one, and hath broken the ſtop of the participation wall, In abrogating through his fleſh the hatred, that is, the Law of commandementes which ſtandeth in ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third vſe is, <hi>obedience, or, the obſeruing &amp; performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the moral ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces</hi> For becauſe the moral law requireth not only internal obedience, but alſo external, whereof the vſe of the miniſterie of the church, and ciuil order are not the loweſt parts: that theſe two therfore may be maintained &amp; preſerued, a defining or limitation of many circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances is neceſſarie, without the equable form &amp; obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof order cannot bee maintained in the church and common wealth. As therfore in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t god hath left free in the miniſtery &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth ſuch conſtitutions &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as may be neceſſarie for the maintaining of this order: ſo in the old Teſtament what he would haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, himſelfe did conſtitute and ordaine. For this is Moral, That there be a publique and ſolemne inuocation and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God: The furtherance and forme hereof god would haue the ceremonies to bee which himſelfe preſcribed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this is Moral, that there be a iuſt and vpright orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of iudgementes, contractes, puniſhmentes, in the common wealth: This order God preſcribed vnto the Iews by Iudicial Lawes. Wherefore <hi>the ceremonies are an adherent of the firſt table, and the iudiciall lawes are an adherent of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:</hi>
                     <pb n="851" facs="tcp:19538:434"/>
becauſe thoſe informe concerning the outwarde and externall forme of the miniſtery of the church or diuine ſeruice and worſhip; theſe, concerning the functions and duties of the Magiſtrates, and of the citizens of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth towardes their Magiſtrates, and towardes one another.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>that manifold obſeruation of rites and ceremonies was alſo an exerciſe, and a teſtification of their obedience towardes God.</hi> For he that dooth willingly and diligently perfourme burdenſome and vnpleaſaunt thinges, if he know the ſame to be pleaſing to God: he then dooth ſhew himſelfe to loue God and to obey him with a readie mind. Therefore ſaith god to Abraham beeing now ready to ſacrifice his Sonne; <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing for my ſake thou haſt not ſpared thine onlie Sonne. So the ceremonial and iudicial ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the old Teſtament are called a yoke,</hi> Acts 15. <hi>and ſeruitude,</hi> Galat. 4.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>vnto moſt of the ceremonies, namelie ſuch as ſignified Chriſtes benefites, was proper and peculiar the ſealing of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt, or the confirmation of faith.</hi> For this is meant when they are ſaid, <hi>to be the ſignes of the couenant,</hi> Gen. 17. Rom. 4. Exod. 31. Ezech. 20. namely, to ſignifie and teſtifie, what benefites God would giue by the Meſſias vnto beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>the iudiciall or ciuill Lawes,</hi> in aſmuch as they were the verie forme of the Moſaical common wealth, <hi>ſerued for the preſeruation of that regiment &amp; kingdom vntil the comming of the Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, <hi>Albeit now the ceremonial and iudicial Lawes are ſo aboliſhed, that the obſeruation of them is not required as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the types; yet thoſe things are perpetual, which are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them.</hi> And therefore they are a confirmation of the newe Teſtament, as well as the oracles and prophecies of the ould Teſtament concerning the Meſſias and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For types are viſible promiſes. Wherefore when as wee ſee thoſe thinges to be fulfilled in Chriſt, which were foretold of him by the prophecies and ſhadowed or prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the old types: it is alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed vnto vs that both he is exhibited, &amp; that this Ieſus, in whom wee beleeue, is that Meſſias which of oulde was promiſed. And although alſo we are not bound to keep and obſerue the ſame rites;
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:19538:435"/>
yet notwithſtanding out of thoſe ould pictures wee learne and vnderſtand what ſpirituall obedience, holyneſſe, and worſhip god continuallie requireth in his church. Whence it is ſaid, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2. <hi>We wil render the calues of our lyps.</hi> Hebr. 13.15. <hi>Let vs by him offer the Sacrifice of praiſe alwaies to God, that is, the fruite of the lyps, which confeſſe his name.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.5. <hi>And yee as liuely ſtones, be made a ſpiritual houſe, and holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode to offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe maie ſuffice for the refuting of Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like, who ſhut the old teſtament out of the church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Furdermore, of the Morall Lawe there are other and greater vſes, becauſe the worſhippe of God dooth properly conſiſt therein, and other Lawes were made for this. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe chiefely doe mens mindes diſpute: when they heare mankind ſo to bee plunged into ſin, that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate cannot ſo much as begin any obedience acceptable to god; neither the Elect in this life attain by any means to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof; &amp; yet notwithſtanding god wil haue the Lawe preached both to the regenerate and vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. For they maruel to what vſe or end the Law is vrged, when obedience cannot poſſibly bee performed. But here it is neceſſarie that we diſtinguiſh and diſcerne the nature of men corrupted from it ſelfe being vncorrupted. For in nature, beeing not as yet depraued or corrupted through ſinne, there were, and ſhal be againe alſo in nature perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored, theſe two vſes of gods lawe eſpecially. The firſt is, the whole and entire conformity of man with god. For there did ſhine, and againe ſhall ſhine in the minde of man, the perfect knowledge of god and his will; and the ſame did woorke, &amp; againe ſhal worke the correſpondence and congruity of all our inclinations and motions with this diuine order, that is, perfect iuſtice and righteouſneſſe before god. For the mind iudging aright, doth rightlie alſo gouern &amp; guide the hart &amp; wil, not being through ſtubbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe peruerted &amp; depraued. Nowe, that both there was perfect knowledge of the law, in mans nature not yet falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and did woorke alſo in it perfect conformity with god, the doctrine concerning the image of god doth teſtify where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto man was created, &amp; which is by Chriſt in vs reſtored.

The other vſe of the Law in nature vncorrupted is a good conſcience, or a certaine perſwaſion of gods fauour, and a certaine hope of eternall life. For when as the Lawe both commandeth perfect obedience, and promiſeth eternall life to thoſe that perfourme it: Therfore it worketh in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vncorrupted, as perfect obedience, ſo alſo certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the reward; according as it is ſaide, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>He that doth them, ſhall liue in them.</hi> Mat. 19. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commaundements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in nature now corrupted there are other effects or vſes of the Law, &amp; thoſe partly accidental, partly the remaines of thoſe proper effectes, which it hath in nature vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; partly in the regenerate, partly in the vnregenerate. As therefore the whole Law is a Schoolemaſter to Chriſt; ſo likewiſe is the Morall, whereof the firſt vſe is both in the regenerate and vnregenerate, <hi>the preſeruing and mantaining of diſcipline both in the church and without alſo.</hi> For the Lawe both being by god himſelfe engrauen in the mindes of all men, and ſpeaking by the voice of teachers &amp; magiſtrats, doth by binding of the conſcience, and by denouncing &amp; ordaining of puniſhments, &amp; by ſhame bridle &amp; reſtraine the vnregenerate alſo, ſo that they ſhunne open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt wickedneſſe, and ſome order is thereby kept in the world amiddeſt the furies of Diuels and wicked men, that mankinde may be preſerued, and the church thence colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and gathered. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is giuen to the lawleſſe and diſobedient.</hi> But albeit this vſe of the law doth chiefely belong vnto the vnregenerate, who are not bridled by the loue of god and righteouſneſſe, but by the feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely &amp; ſhame, not to make open profeſſion of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe: yet hath it place alſo in the godly. For they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede haue another bridle whereby they are guided, euen the holy ghoſt illightening and inclining their harts vnto obedience: but yet by reaſon of the weakenes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fleſh prone to ſinne, experience teacheth, that this chaine and bonde alſo is profitable and neceſſary for them, for the ſhunning and auoiding of tranſgreſſions. Many places alſo of Scripture witneſſe this, which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten euen vnto the ſaintes, if they run into grieuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, grieuous puniſhments: As, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>If the righteous
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:19538:436"/>
turne away from his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity, hee ſhall die for it:</hi> And the examples of puniſhmentes; as of Eli, of Dauid, and many others. For therefore both threatnings and examples are ſet before the godly, to keepe them in good order.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond vſe is, <hi>the acknowledgement and accuſing of ſinne in the regenerate and vnregenerate.</hi> Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> Rom. 7.7. <hi>J knew nothing but by the Lawe; for neither had I knowen luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> This vſe of the Law belongeth vnto all men: becauſe all haue ſo much knowledge of the Lawe as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to breede in them a pricke and remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But there is a double effect hereof. For in the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate the knowledge of ſin, &amp; of the iudgement of God againſt ſin, engendereth an hatred of god, &amp; an increaſe of ſinne. For ſo much the more doth nature not yet regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deſire to commit and excuſe ſinne, and murmureth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; how much the more the law vrgeth and preſſeth the prohibition and condemnation of ſinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>The Law cauſeth wrath.</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>Sinne took an occaſion by the commandement, and wrought in mee al manner of concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</hi> Moreouer if thoſe vnregenerate be alſo reprobate, then woorketh it at length in them deſpaire and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Therefore, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. it is called <hi>the miniſtery of death.</hi> But in the elect the knowledge of ſinne is a preparing of them vnto conuerſion. For it woorketh in them a deſire of Gods fauour, and of deliuerance from ſinne, &amp; enforceth them, deſpairing of their own righteouſneſſe, to ſeeke for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and life in Chriſt their Mediatour. And after they are once conuerted, it continually inſtructeth them with due contrition, truely to humble themſelues in the ſight of God, and maketh them to profit and goe forwarde daily in true conuerſion vnto God, and in the dread &amp; fear of God. Now although many wicked men beeing blinded with ſecurity, doe not acknowledge their ſinne for a time: yet the Law accuſeth all, and the terrours and torments of conſcience doe at length oppreſſe them. Vnto the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate alſo, although they neither are ſubiect to damnation, neither liue without the acknowledgement and bewailing of their ſinne, yet neceſſary is the preaching &amp; meditation
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:19538:436"/>
of the Law, that thereby they more and more knowing the remnants of ſinne, which are in them, may continue and go foreward in true repentance and amendment of life. Moreouer concerning both theſe vſes, namely, <hi>the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Diſcipline, and acknowledgement of ſinne,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>that the Lawe is a Schoolemaſter vnto Chriſt.</hi> For neither can men be inſtructed concerning god, neither doth the holy ghoſt woorke faith and conuerſion in their heartes, except open and manifeſt tranſgreſſions be eſchewed, and they perſiſt not in ſinnes againſt their conſcience. <hi>Jſai.</hi> 66. <hi>J will regard the poore and contrite in ſpirite.</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>If yee mortifie the deedes of the bodie by the ſpirite, ye ſhall liue: but if yee liue after the fleſhe, ye ſhall die.</hi> Neither do they indeede ſeeke for &amp; deſire earneſtly deliueraunce from ſinne and death, who doe not truely knowe and agniſe the greatneſſe of ſinne. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.41. <hi>If yee were blind, yee ſhould not haue ſinne; but now yee ſay, Wee ſee: Therefore your ſinne remaineth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third vſe of the moral Law is proper vnto the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, to witte, <hi>an inſtructing and informing of them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true ſeruice and woorſhip of God.</hi> This is done by the doctrine of the Lawe in teaching and exhorting. For, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are yet remaining manifold ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and corrupt inclination in the Saintes; they ſtand in neede not only of the continuall conduct of gods word, but alſo of the ſpurres and prouokements of exhortations, and of meditation on gods will; leaſt either they er in their purpoſe and counſail, or alſo ſeeing that which is good, be neuertheleſſe carried the quite contrary way. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1.2. <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi> Pſal. 19.7 <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerting the ſoul: the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, &amp; giueth wiſdome to the ſimple. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right &amp; reioice the heart: the commandement of the Lorde is pure, &amp; giueth light vnto the eies. Moreouer by them is thy ſeruant made circumſpect, and in keepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them there is great reward.</hi> Pſalm. 119.50. <hi>Thy worde is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path.</hi> Ier. 31.33. <hi>J will put my Law in their inward partes, and write it in their hartes.</hi> Wherefore wee ſee alſo that Chriſt and the Apoſtles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the commaundementes and explication of the law not ſo much to prophane and wicked men, as to the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:19538:437"/>
&amp; godly. Againſt this vſe of the Law ſome obiect that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Ye are dead to the law by the body of Chriſt, that yee ſhould be vnto another, euen vnto him that is raiſed vp from the dead, that ye ſhould bring forth fruite vnto God.</hi> And Gal. 2 <hi>I through the lawe, am dead to the lawe, and that I might liue vnto God, I am crucified with Chriſt. Thus I liue yet; not I now, but Chriſt liueth in me, and in that that J nowe liue in the fleſh, I liue by the faith in the Sonne of God.</hi> Hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: <hi>If we be dead to the law, and are Chriſts, who now liueth in vs; then is not our life nowe ſchooled and ruled by the direction of the lawe, but by Chriſt only.</hi> But ſeeing the Apoſtle himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>That the lawe is not made voide, but eſtabliſhed by faith;</hi> this phraſe, <hi>to die vnto the law,</hi> dooth not ſignifie to bee exempted from the obedience of the Lawe, but to bee freed from condemnation, and from the prouokement of ſin, which the Lawe worketh in the vnregenerate, whereas we beeing engraffed into Chriſt, enioy in him both a full ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, for which the Lawe condemned vs, and the ſpirit of regeneration bending &amp; inclining our heartes, not to an hatred of the Lawe, wherewith they firſt did burne, but to the ſtudie and deſire of obedience and righteouſneſſe. Therefore he addeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>That yee ſhould bee vnto another, who is raiſed vp from the dead, that wee ſhould bring forth fruite vnto God.</hi> Againe, <hi>wee are deliuered from the Law, beeing dead vnto it, wherein we were holden, that we ſhould ſerue in newneſſe of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſſe of the letter.</hi> In the other place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. this is the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>J through the Law,</hi> to wit, which accuſeth ſinnes, and terrifieth the conſciences of men, <hi>am dead to the Lawe,</hi> that is, ceaſe to ſeeke for righteouſneſſe in the Lawe, and begin to ſeeke for it in Chriſt. For this is it which he addeth, <hi>J am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> namely, by the participation of Chriſts merit, and the mortification of ſinne, <hi>that J might liue to God,</hi> according to the will of God expreſſed in the Lawe. <hi>For he liueth to God,</hi> who obeieth God, and honoreth him through his obedience. But this the doctrine of the Lawe, doth not woorke in nature nowe corrupted, except wee paſſe from the Lawe to Chriſt by faith, that hee maie liue in vs, and wee in him, that is, that he may be effectual in vs through the working of his holy ſpirit; firſt, <hi>by ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:19538:437"/>
&amp; ſpeaking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in our hearts, of the remiſſion of our ſins,</hi> then, <hi>by making vs like vnto himſelfe by regeneration,</hi> that the Law may no longer condemne vs and cauſe wrath; but <hi>wee may dilight in the law of God, concerning the inner man;</hi> Rom. 7. So then are wee deliuered from the Lawe, and die to the Law, ſo Chriſt liueth in vs, that wee beginne to delight in the Law, and to order our life according to the preſcript thereof. For Chriſt doth not reſtore any other righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or any other image of God in vs by his ſpirite, than which was created by our nature, darkened and ecclipſed by ſinne, and deſcribed in the law: neither is there another ſpirite, author of Gods lawe, and worker of our conformity with God in our nature vncorrupted and reſtored.</p>
                  <p>They alleadge alſo that which is ſaid, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.31. <hi>I wil make a new couenant with the houſe of Iſrael, not according to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, that I made with their Fathers. Heere they ſaie, That God promiſeth not to renue the old couenaunt, which is the Law, but to make a new, which is the goſpell. Wherefore not the Law, but the goſpel onelie is to be taught in the church of Chriſt.</hi> But it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that <hi>the new couenant</hi> is not diuerſe from the ould, as touching the ſubſtantiall, but onely as touching the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental partes or conditions, and circumſtances thereof. For although the old ſhadowes and darke types are taken awaie, and a moſt cleare Doctrine, of the prophecie and figures fulfilled by Chriſt, hath ſucceeded; &amp; the grace of the holy ghoſt is ſhed more plentifully on men in the new Teſtament than in the old: yet notwithſtanding there was one and the ſame manner and waie both of obtaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and of gods ſpirituall worſhip, in times paſt, that now is. Vnto this beare witneſſe the wordes themſelues of the Prophet Ier: <hi>I will write in their hearts my Lawe,</hi> hee ſaith not another Lawe, but the ſame which in times paſt I gaue them: <hi>I wil be their God, and they ſhal be my people: J wil forgiue their iniquitie, and wil remember their ſinnes no more.</hi> For theſe conditions of the couenaunt are found as well in the ould as in the new. The difference only is, that theſe are not the proper benefits of the Lawe, but of the goſpel, which two parts of the old and new Teſtament the Prophet here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth one to the other, calling <hi>the lawe the oulde couenaunt,</hi> and <hi>the Goſpel, the new couenant,</hi> as beeing the principal part
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:19538:438"/>
of the couenant: and therefore he aſcribeth theſe bleſſings vnto the newe couenaunt, becauſe thereon depended whatſoeuer grace of God befel vnto the olde church, and therein are thoſe things more fully manifeſted &amp; exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, which were alſo promiſed &amp; graunted in the old for Chriſt. If then God will write the Law, which was firſt written in tables of ſtone, in the hearts of men in his new couenaunt: he doth not aboliſh, but eſtabliſh the Law by the preaching of the Goſpel, whereby the harts of men are regenerated, that they may begin to obey the Law: and therefore hee deliuering heere a difference betweene the Law &amp; the Goſpel, doth ſo ſubſtitute the new couenant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the old, as that he ſaith, that that part of the couenaunt, which is the Moral Law, muſt bee reteined and written in our harts. Now if they vrge thoſe words, which the prophet addeth: <hi>They ſhall teach no more euerie man his neighbour, for they ſhal al know me:</hi> That hereby they may conclude, <hi>That men are not in the newe Teſtament to bee willed to knowe God, for that they ſhal of themſelues know him and obey him:</hi> they er too groſſely, going aboue to remooue the inſtrumentall cauſe, by reaſon that the effect in the new Teſtament is greater and more plentifull. For, that men may know God and of their own accord obey him, the holy Ghoſt worketh by the doctrine of the Lawe and the Goſpell. Neither doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>that they are not bound, neither are to bee vrged by incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of exhortation, becauſe they doe their dutie of themſelues:</hi> For binding and exhorting is a far other thing, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining. <hi>Wherfore in two reſpectes hath the law place in inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the regenerate,</hi> namely, that they maie learne of the Lawe the will of God, and may alſo by the Lawe bee more and more incited willinglie to obey God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>The Moral Law is a teſtimonie of God, that there is a god, and likewiſe who and what he is.</hi> This is a leſſe principall vſe of the Lawe, as alſo thoſe that followe: but the former are principal vſes of the Lawe. 5. <hi>Jt is a teſtimonie of the church.</hi> For ſeeing in the Church onely the doctrine of the Lawe hath beene preſerued pure and vncorrupt, which all other ſects haue, by aſſenting to manifeſt errours and impieties, diuerſlie corrupted: the voice of the Lawe which ſoundeth in the church, is an euident teſtimonie, diſciphring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:19538:438"/>
which is the people of God, and which is true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world. 6. <hi>Jt is a teſtimonie of the excellencie of mans nature which was before the fall, and which ſhall bee in the life to come,</hi> that is, it remembreth vs of the Image of god in man, which was created in him, and which is reſtored in him by Chriſt. 7. <hi>Jt is a teſtimonie of eternal life.</hi> For the Law muſt be obſerued by vs, becauſe it was not in vaine giuen vs. And ſeeing in this life the Lawe hath not his ende in vs; there muſt needs be therefore remaining yet another life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to liue according to the preſcript of the law, that ſo at length the Lawe may be fulfilled of vs. Wherefore in reſpect of al theſe cauſes and vſes, let vs conclude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, that the Law of god is to be inculcated in the church of Chriſt, both after and before the doctrine of the goſpel, and is continually and diligently to be meditated on by all men; according to the doctrin deliuered in the firſt Pſalm; <hi>His delight is in the Lawe of God, and in his Lawe doth he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate both day and night.</hi>

We eaſily grant, that wiſe and diſcreete magiſtrates and law-giuers may take as wel thence as out of other gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, if there bee anie thing conuenient and agreeing with their ſubiects, with whom, &amp; the times wherein they liue, ſo that all opinion of neceſſity bee taken away, that is, ſo that it bee not therefore commaunded, or reteined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was preſcribed by Moſes to the Iewes; but becauſe there are good reaſons, wherefore nowe alſo it ſhoulde bee doone ſo, and if the cauſes be chaunged, then that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty alſo of changing theſe lawes by publicke autority be reteined.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, although ceremoniall and ciuill lawes are wholy abrogated as touching obedience alſo; yet is not the Morall law in like manner abrogated. For this, after Chriſt was exhibited, ceaſed indeede <hi>as touching the curſe and conſtraint, but not as touching obedience.</hi> The reaſons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſtrong and cleare. Firſt, <hi>The Sonne of god was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made Mediatour, tooke the forme of a ſeruant, became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto his Father, euen vnto the death of the Croſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs from the curſe of the Law, that we ſhould continue and perſiſt in ſinnes and enmity with God; but that hee might deliuer vs from ſinne, reconcile vs vnto God, and make vs againe like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god, &amp; the temple of god.</hi> If then he had this end, for which hee did deliuer vs from the curſe of the Lawe, hee did not withall take away the bond of our obedience. For this is the Mediatours office, to expiate and do away ſins, and to bring to paſſe, that hereafter the party offended bee no more offended by that party which had offended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>how much the more and greater Gods benefites are towardes vs, ſo much the more are we bound to yeeld thankefulnes vnto him,</hi> that is, to liue according to his will and Law. But they who are iuſtified and regenerated by faith in Chriſt, haue receiued moe and greater benefits than others. For theſe are ouermore added vnto their creation, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and other benefits common to the wicked with the godly. Therefore we are more bound after, than before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and iuſtification, to yeeld and performe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Law. Many teſtimonies confirme the ſame; as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets: J am not come to deſtroy them, but to fulfill them.</hi> This
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:19538:440"/>
is meant of all the parts of the Lawe, but eſpecially of the morall Lawe. <hi>For Chriſt fulfilleth the Law foure waies.</hi> Firſt, by his owne righteouſneſſe. For Chriſt onely hath perfectly performed ſuch obedience as the Lawe requireth: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the ſonne of God and conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, and alſo becauſe hee could not haue ſatisfied for vs, except himſelfe were free from all ſpot or ſtaine of ſinne. <hi>Heb</hi> 7 26. <hi>Such a high Prieſt it became vs to haue, which is holy, harmeleſſe, vndefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> Secondly, <hi>by paying ſufficient puniſhment for our ſinnes.</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>For (that that was impoſſible to the Lawe, in aſmuch as it was weake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fleſh) god ſending his owne Sonne in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinnefull fleſhe, and for ſinne, condemned ſinne in the fleſhe, that the righteouſeneſſe of the Lawe might bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in vs, which walke not after the fleſhe, but after the ſpirite.</hi> 2. Cor. 5.21. <hi>He made him to be ſinne for vs, which knew no ſinne, that we ſhould be made the righteouſnes of God.</hi> And this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the types of the lawe, &amp; the paying of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which wee did owe, is that verie abrogating of the Lawe, whereof wee haue ſpoken. Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt fulfilleth the Lawe in vs by his ſpirite, reforming vs by him vnto the image of God,</hi> that we alſo may in this life begin internall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall obedience which the lawe requireth of vs, &amp; may perfourme the ſame whole and entire in the life to come. Now both theſe, to wit, puniſhment paide for vs by Chriſt, and righteouſnes begun in vs, are comprehended and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode by S. Paul, when he ſaith, <hi>That the righteouſnes of the lawe is fulfilled in vs, which walke after the ſpirite:</hi> And of the giuing of the Holie Ghoſt and of regeneration, which is wrought for and by Chriſt, S. Paul purpoſely entreateth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt fulfilleth the lawe by teaching it,</hi> that is, by repurging and purifying it from errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and by reſtoring the true doctrine and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof; which he doth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. If then Chriſt both teacheth and reſtoreth the obedience of the lawe in vs; he doth not aboliſh the lawe, as concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. The ſame doth Paul teach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make the lawe of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea wee eſtabliſh the lawe. Now by faith, or by the righteouſnes and iuſtice of faith the Law is eſtabliſhed, not onely in confeſſing or approuing
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:19538:441"/>
the iudgement and accuſation of the Lawe againſt vs,</hi> as, that we doe not yeeld due obedience vnto the Lawe, for aſmuch as we ſeeke for righteouſneſſe without our ſelues in Chriſt; <hi>&amp; in ſatisfieng,</hi> becauſe through faith is applied vnto vs chriſts ſatisfaction, equiualent to eternall puniſhment, which the Law required of vs not performing perfect obedience: by this faith then it is wrought, that without the Law indeed, that is, not by our owne obedience, but yet not againſt the Lawe, that is, not without anothers perfect ſatisfaction for vs, we are iuſtified before God: <hi>but the Lawe is alſo eſtabliſhed by faith through the beginning of newe obedience in this life, and the acompliſhing of the ſame in the life to come.</hi> Acts. 15. <hi>Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng their hearts by faith.</hi> Gal. 5.5. <hi>We through the ſpirite waite for the hope of righteouſneſſe through faith.</hi> Theſe and the like aſſeuerations, that the Decalogue is to be taught in the new Teſtament, and the commaundementes of chriſt and the Apoſtles agreeing with the Decalogue, doe moſt euidently refute the impiety of Antinomies, Libertines, and ſuch like, who contend that the law is not to be taught in the church of chriſt. The ſame alſo may be gathered out of the vſe of Gods Law, which vſe thereof ſeeing it muſt be continuall in the church; it followeth that the Law it ſelfe alſo muſt be perpetual. Which that it may be the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, let the chiefe obiections oppoſed againſt it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Obiection. <hi>Chriſt is not the Law-giuer,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>The Lawe was giuen by Moſes: but grace and trueth came by Chriſt. Therefore neither he, nor the miniſters of the Goſpell ſhould teach the Law.</hi> Aunſwere. Chriſt is not the Law-giuer, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the chiefe and principall function and office of the Mediatour. For that is, to bring foorth the goſpell out of the boſome of his father, to make requeſt and interceſſion to be made a ſacrifice for vs, and by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt to reconcile vs vnto God. But a part notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this office is, to ſhew and take away thoſe errours, wherewith the Lawe is corrupted, and to propound the pure Doctrine thereof to this end, that the mindes of men may thereby bee prepared to heare the preaching of the goſpel, which is proper vnto the Meſſias, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerted may be inſtructed, what thankefulnes God
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:19538:441"/>
requireth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the benefit of their redemption. <hi>Chriſt then is the Law-giuer,</hi> as he is God, and author of the law to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the father: but as hee is Mediatour, hee is not indeed the law-giuer, becauſe he publiſheth not the Law, as it is ſaide, 1. <hi>John.</hi> 2. but yet notwithſtanding hee is the purger, repairer, and reſtorer of the law from corruptions; and this, not principally; but that hee might performe the principall function of his Mediatourſhip, to wit, our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement &amp; ſaluation. The ſame anſwere we make alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the miniſters of the goſpell: in aſmuch as they are to propound no other Doctrine vnto the Church, than Chriſt hath deliuered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Obiect. <hi>Hee that hath ſatisfied the Lawe by puniſhment is not bound to obedience: becauſe the Lawe bindeth either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment or to obedience, but not vnto both together. But wee haue ſatisfied the Lawe by Chriſts puniſhment. Therefore we ſtand not bound to perfourm obedience.</hi> Aunſwere. We diſtinguiſh the Maior. Firſt, <hi>he that hath ſuffered a ſufficient puniſhment is not bound to obedience,</hi> to witte, not to the ſame obedience for the omitting whereof he ſuffered puniſhment: but after that ſatisfaction hath been made by puniſhment for ſinne committed; he is bound notwithſtanding hence forwarde to obey the lawe, or to ſuffer newe puniſhment, if through new diſobedience he breake the lawe. Secondly, hee that hath ſatisfied not by his owne puniſhment but by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and is receiued into fauour without his owne ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ought to obey the lawe, though not as thereby to ſatisfie for ſinnes, yet to ſhewe his thankefulnes, that is, hee ought to order and direct his life according to his will by whom he is redeemed, and of whom he is receiued into fauour. For no man is therefore puniſhed for ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or deliuered from the crime therof, that he ſhould perſiſt in it, but that he ſhould leaue off hence forwarde to commit ſin any more, and to offend him, vnto whom hee is reconciled. Wherefore in like manner wee alſo, becauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied for our ſins, ſtand bound to performe the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not of the time paſt, but of the time to come: and this alſo are we bound to perfourme, not for any expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or recompence of thoſe ſins, which either wee haue committed, or doe commit, or hereafter ſhall commit, but
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:19538:442"/>
for the ſhewing of our thankefulneſſe for the benefite of Chriſt, whereby wee are deliuered from ſinne and death. This doth S. Paul teach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Hee that is dead, is free from ſinne.</hi> Againe: <hi>Likewiſe thinke ye alſo that yee are dead to ſinne, but are aliue to god in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Obiection. <hi>Chriſtians are not ruled by the Lawe, but by the ſpirite of regeneration, according as it is ſaid, ye are not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace.</hi> Againe, <hi>The lawe is not giuen vnto the righteous man. Therefore it is not to be taught in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> Aunſwere. Chriſtians are not ruled, that is, are not compelled and conſtrained by the law and feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vnto whatſoeuer diſcipline or order, like as are the wicked: but yet they are taught and inſtructed by the law of God, what worſhip is pleaſing vnto god, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt vſeth the voice of the Lawe to teach and incline them to an obedience not conſtrained or hypocritical, but true and voluntary, ſo that not only the Law commandeth them what to doe, but the ſpirite alſo of grace dooth giue them ability to obay. For this is, <hi>not to be vnder the Law, and the Law not to be giuen vnto the righteous.</hi> So then the bond and Doctrine remaineth, albeit the condemnation and conſtraint is taken away. For vnto this are wee bound, that our obedience be moſt free and voluntary. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. <hi>We are debters, not to the fleſh, to liue after the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Obiection. <hi>The Lawe is not neceſſarie vnto ſaluation. Therefore it is not to be taught in the Church.</hi> Aunſwere. This reaſon is a fallacie reaſoning that not to bee ſimplie ſo, which is not in ſome reſpect ſo. For albeit the Lawe is not neceſſarie to this, that wee ſhoulde through our obedience vnto it be ſaued: yet is it neceſſarie vnto other thinges, as hath beene taught already in the doctrine concerning the vſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Obiection. <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 2.3. <hi>Jn Chriſt are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge.</hi> Againe, <hi>Yee are complete in him. Therefore there is no neede of the Lawe in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> Aunſwere. This reaſon deceiueth by inferring a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, becauſe it proceedeth from the putting of the whole, to the denial of a part. The whole wiſedome and knowledge, that is, the Doctrine of Chriſt deliuered by him vnto vs, is ſufficient &amp; neceſſary for the Church: But
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:19538:442"/>
a part of that Doctrine is the Morall Lawe alſo: becauſe Chriſt commanded not faith only, but repentance alſo &amp; amendment of life to be preached in his name; &amp; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe deliuered and declared the Lawe. The compleatneſſe therefore and perfection of our wiſedome and ſaluation, which we haue in Chriſt, doth not exclude, but include ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and comprehend the Doctrine of the Law.</p>

                  <head>6 <hi>How the Decalogue is diuided.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE diuiſion of the Decalogue is to bee obſerued and reteined, becauſe it maketh to the vnderſtanding of the commandements themſelues. For firſt, <hi>it ſheweth that in ſome commandements is preſcribed mediate worſhippe, in ſome immeditat.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, <hi>it aduertiſeth vs of the degrees of obedience, and ſheweth that the woorſhippe of the firſt table is the chiefe and principall.</hi> Nowe, <hi>the Decalogue is diuided after a threefolde manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>the Decalog is diuided by Moſes and Chriſt into two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: The former whereof compriſeth our duties towardes God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie: The ſecond, our duties towards God mediatelie.</hi> This diuiſion is grounded on this, that Chriſt and Paul refer the whole Law to the loue of God and our neighbour. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with al thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and withal thy mind. This is the firſt and great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; and the ſecond is like vnto this, Thou ſhalt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the Decalog is diuided into ten commaundementes, whereof foure are aſcribed vnto the firſt, and the ſixe other vnto the ſecond table.</hi> This diuiſion is oppugned by them, who goe about to contract and drawe the firſt and the ſecond commaundement vnto one, and contrariwiſe to diuide the tenth into two. Now for the refutall of theſe mens errour, we wil bring foorth the ſpecial reaſons, whereby this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is confirmed. <hi>Thoſe are diſtinct commaundementes which are diſtinguiſhed in the matter which they deliuer, or whoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is diſtinct and diuerſe.</hi> The firſt and ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment differ or are diſtinguiſhed in matter. Therefore they are diuerſe and diſtinct commaundementes. <hi>The firſt</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, who is to be worſhipped, namely the alone true god. <hi>The ſecond</hi> ſheweth how God is to be worſhipped, namely not by the inuentions of men. So of the contrary, <hi>the tenth
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:19538:443"/>
commandment cannot be diuided into two commandements.</hi> For thoſe things that are there ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence, haue one &amp; the ſame meaning &amp; ſenſe, and therefore the ſcripture alſo compriſeth them vnder one name. <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet or luſt. I had not known luſt, except the law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> But if therefore yet the tenth commandement muſt be cut into two diuerſe commandements, becauſe it maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diuerſe things not to be coueted or luſted after; it ſhal thereof follow, that ſo many commandements muſt be numbered, as there are recited kindes of thinges in euery commaundement. 2. <hi>Thoſe commaundementes which differ one from another in verſes and periodes or ſentences, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in themſelues alſo and are diſtinguiſhed by Moſes.</hi> The firſt commaundement then differeth from the ſecond, becauſe Moſes hath diſtinguiſhed theſe two commaundementes in diuerſe verſes and periodes. Contrariwiſe, thoſe thinges which are deliuered by Moſes in the tenth commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are comprehended all in one periode or ſentence: Wherefore al of them are to bee referred iointly alſo vnto one commaundement. 3. <hi>Moſes tranſpoſeth the wordes of the tenth commaundement</hi> (which the aduerſaries attempt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide into two commaundementes, the ninth and tenth) in Exodus and Deutronomy. For in Exodus is placed firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 20.17.</note> and then followeth that which is placed firſt in Deutronomie, <hi>Thou ſhal not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet thy neighbours wife.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 5.21.</note> If then our aduerſaries will needes diuide this tenth into two commandmentes, they ſhal not bee able to know which muſt be the ninth, and which the tenth: yea by this meanes they ſhall accuſe Moſes, &amp; God himſelfe ſpeaking by Moſes of lightneſſe, as if hee were contrary vnto himſelfe. By this tranſpoſing therefore and diſplacing of the woords, the holie ghoſt dooth ſufficiently declare, that he would haue al to be but one commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whatſoeuer is reade in the tenth commaundement iointly comprehended and conteined in one periode or ſentence. 4. <hi>There is verie great and weightie authoritie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this diuiſion of the Decalogue is confirmed.</hi> For the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Iewes, <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> doe thus diuide the Decalogue. In like ſort doe the greek Eccleſiaſtical writers diuide the Decalogue: As <hi>Zonarus, Origen, Athanaſius, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:19538:443"/>
Nazianzene, Chryſoſtome, and Nicephorus.</hi> And vnto this opinion and ſentence ſubſcribe alſo the latine Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers, as <hi>Hierome, Ambroſe, Sulpitius Seuerus, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi> We haue therefore reſtored, not chaunged or altered the Decalogue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Decalogue is diuided according to the thinges themſelues, which are commanded or forbidden in the Decalogue.</hi> Now generally in the Decalogue is commanded the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: that which is contrary to Gods worſhip is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. <hi>The worſhippe of God is either immediate,</hi> when Moral woorks are immediately perfourmed vnto God: <hi>or mediate,</hi> when Moral works are perfourmed vnto our neighbour in reſpect of God. <hi>The immediat worſhip is either internal or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. The internal</hi> conſiſteth in this, <hi>partlie that we worſhippe the true god, and that that be performed vnto the true God,</hi> which is commaunded in the firſt commaundement; <hi>partlie that the manner or forme of worſhippe be right and lawful, whether it be internal worſhip, or external.</hi> This forme, which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in Gods worſhip, is taught in the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. <hi>The external worſhip, is either priuate or publique. The priuate conteineth the priuate Moral works of euerie one, which are alwaies to be of euerie man in particular performed:</hi> and this priuate worſhip is deliuered in the third commandement. <hi>The publique worſhip conſiſteth in ſanctifieng of the Sabboth,</hi> and is deliuered in the fourth commaundement. <hi>The mediate worſhip of God, which conteineth our duties towardes men, or our neighbours, is deliuered in the ſecond table: and this likewiſe is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther external or internal. The mediate external worſhip conſiſteth partly in the duties of ſuperiours towardes their inferiours, and ſo of the contrarie:</hi> of which duties (as alſo of ciuill order com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed vnder them) is ſpoken in the fift commaundement: <hi>partlie in the duties of one neighbour towards another,</hi> which are ratified in the reſt of the commaundementes; <hi>and thoſe are either the preſeruing of mens life and ſafetie,</hi> which is in the ſixt commaundement; <hi>or the preſeruing of chaſtitie and wedlocke,</hi> which is in the ſeuenth commandement; <hi>or the preſeruing of goods or poſſeſsions,</hi> which is in the eight; <hi>or of the preſeruing of the truth,</hi> which is conteined in the ninth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. <hi>The mediate internal worſhip, or the internall and inward duties of mediate worſhippe conſiſt in the internall affection of the heart:
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:19538:444"/>
for they are the verie vprightneſſe of mens affections towardes their neighbour,</hi> which is to bee included and vnderſtoode in al the former commandements: and is preſcribed in the tenth and laſt commandement.</p>

                  <p>Certain rules concerning the ſubſtance &amp; meaning of the Decalogue in generall.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The Morall Law or Decalogue is to bee vnderſtoode accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the interpretation of the Scripture,</hi> that is, according to the expoſition and declaration of the Prophets, Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles: and not according to the ſenſe and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man only, or Philoſophy.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The Decalog requireth in al the commaundementes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both external &amp; internal, perfect, not in parts onlie, but alſo in degrees,</hi> that is, that we obey God not onely in al the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſcribed, but in the degrees alſo of thoſe duties. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be he that abideth not in al.</hi>

This rule alſo is of force in humane Lawes. But we are to vnderſtand it of the next and neereſt end of the Law. For not thoſe thinges which are neceſſarie to the

The furtheſt end, and therefore the end of the whole Law, is the worſhippe of god: It requireth therefore the whole obedience of the Law. The end of the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is the preſeruation of the ſociety of mankinde: this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth al the duties of the ſecond table. The end of the fift commaundement is, the preſeruation of ciuill order; it compriſeth therefore the duties of ſuperiors towards infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and of inferiors towards ſuperiours: becauſe without theſe ciuil order cannot be preſerued.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>The ſame vertue is often in a diuerſe reſpect commaunded in diuerſe commandementes,</hi> that is, the ſame vertue is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the performing of obedience vnto many comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes.

For God is not loued, except our neighbour be loued; neither is our neighbour trulie loued, except God be loued; 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. Hence alſo aunſwere may be made to this obiection: <hi>The ſecond table muſt yeelde vnto the firſt: Therefore ceremonies which are duties of the firſt table, muſt be preferred before the duties of loue and charitie towardes our neighbour;</hi> For the ſecond table yeeldeth vnto the firſt in moral duties, not in ceremonial. If therefore the neceſſitie and ſafety of our neighbour require the omitting of a ceremony, the ceremonie is rather to be omitted, than the ſafetie of our neighbour to bee neglected. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>I wil haue mercie, and not ſacrifice.</hi> Mat. 15.4. <hi>God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſaieng, Honour thy Father and Mother: and hee that curſeth Father or Mother, let him die the death: But yee ſaie, whoſoeuer ſhall ſaie to Father or Mother, By the gift that is offered by mee, thou maieſt haue profite, Though he honour not his Father, or his Mother, ſhal be free: Thus haue yee made the commaundement of God of no autority by your tradition.</hi> Offeringes and ſacrifices were commanded by God: but if they be don with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the neceſſities of our parents &amp; kinred, Chriſt ſaith that they are not an obſeruing, but a breach of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.

Firſt, <hi>he ſaith that he is Iehouah,</hi> whereby he diſtinguiſheth himſelfe the true god from all creatures, that he may ſhew himſelfe to haue the chiefe right of ruling. <hi>I am Iehouah;</hi> That is, I, whom thou heareſt ſpeaking, &amp; giuing this Law vnto thee, am the true God, who is and exiſteth from himſelfe and by himſelfe, &amp; giueth vnto other things their being, Creator of al things, eternall, omnipotent, author and preſeruer of all that are good. Therefore obay me. Secondly he ſaith, <hi>that he is the god of his people,</hi> that through the promiſe of his bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he might allure vs to obay him. <hi>God verilie is the God of

This he addeth, that by the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his late and notable benefit he might declare vnto them and admoniſh them that they were bound therfore to ſhew thankfulneſſe and obedience vnto him. This alſo belongeth vnto vs, becauſe it dooth figuratiuelie compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend &amp; implie all the deliueraunces of the church, by the mentioning of ſo famous and noble a benefit. And further alſo, this was a type of our woonderful deliuerance atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Chriſt. Nowe when hee ſaith, <hi>that hee Iehoua is this god and deliuerer of the Church,</hi> he oppoſeth himſelfe both to all creatures &amp; to Idols, challenging all diuine honour &amp; obedience vnto himſelfe alone: according to the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof deliuered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Jſa.</hi> 43. and in other places.

               <p>Next enſeweth the commaundement, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods before me.</hi> The end of this commaundement is the inward or internal woorſhip of God, that is, that due honour may bee giuen vnto God in the minde, will, and heart of man.

               </p>
               <p>The feare and loue of god differ. For <hi>the loue of god ariſeth from a knowledge of gods goodneſſe: The fear of god ariſeth from a knowledge of gods iuſtice, and of his power to puniſh ſinnes, and of that right which he hath ouer al creatures.</hi> Againe, <hi>Loue purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good, to wit, god and our coniunction with him:</hi> wherefore the loue of god is, not to abide to be bereaued of god, who is the chiefe good. <hi>But fear flieth euill, to wit, the diſpleaſure and wrath of god, and our ſeparation from him.</hi> Wherefore alſo the fear of god is, to beware that we offend not god. Moreouer the fear of god which was in the nature of man vncorrupt, differeth from that, which is now in the regenerate in this life, and which is in the bleſſed Angels and Saintes in the celeſtial life. <hi>The feare of god which is in the bleſſed in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life,</hi> is a high deteſtation of ſinne and puniſhmentes, without griefe, becauſe neither anie ſinne is in them, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny puniſhment of ſin, and they are aſſured that they ſhall neuer ſinne or be puniſhed. <hi>Jſa.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Hee wil deſtroie death for euer, and the Lord God wil wipe awaie the tears from al faces.

So is it ſaide of Peter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 75. <hi>So he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> This Sonne-like fear differeth from a ſeruile or ſlauiſh fear: becauſe <hi>this ſon-like feare ariſeth from a confidence and loue of god,</hi> and therfore principallie it ſhunneth the diſpleaſing and offending of God, and is certaine of euerlaſting life. <hi>Seruile feare ariſeth from a knowledge, and an accuſing of ſinne, and from a feeling of gods iudgement and anger againſt ſinne,</hi> and is a ſhunning and hatred of God, and puniſhment, not of ſinne, and is ſo much the greater, how much the more certaine expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is of euerlaſting damnation, and howe much the greater deſpaire there is of the grace and mercy of God. This feare of God is in diuels, and in the wicked, and is that beginning of euerlaſting death, which the wicked feele in this life. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>J heard thy voice in the garden, and was afraide.</hi> Iames, 2. <hi>The Diuels beleeue and tremble.</hi> Iſai. 57. <hi>There is no peace vnto the wicked.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing it is an hatred and ſhunning, not of ſinne, but of God, and is repugnant to the faith and loue of God, it is not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but forbiddden in this commaundement. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.18. <hi>There is no feare in loue, but perfect loue caſteth out feare: for fear hath painfulneſſe: and he that feareth is not perfect in loue.</hi> Now, becauſe in the Saintes, in this life, neither faith nor loue are perfect, but are often ſhaken with many tentations and doubts, therefore, albeit this Sonne-like feare is begunne in them, yet is it neuer in that puritie, but that ſome ſeruile feare is mingled with it. Examples hereof are riſe and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Pſalmes, and in the booke of Iob. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 32.3. <hi>When J held my tongue my bones conſumed, when J roared al the

Iohn. 5.2. <hi>In this wee know that wee loue the childen of god, when we loue god and keep his commandments.</hi> The reaſon heereof is, becauſe the knowledge of God, the feare and loue of God, and faith, are cauſes of our whole obedience, and they who truly loue and feare God, wil not offend him in any thing, but endeuor to do al thinges plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto him and acceptable.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Two things are heere contained, <hi>a Commaundement, and an Exhortation to obedience.</hi> The Exhortation which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto the commaundement, conſiſteth of fiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of God, which ought to ſtir vs vp to obay GOD. 1 <hi>He calleth himſelfe our God.,</hi> that is, our maker and Sauior, and the author of all good things. Heereby then he aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeth vs what execrable vnthankefulneſſe it is, to reuolt from the true worſhiping of him vnto Idolatrie. 2 He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe a <hi>mightie God,</hi> that is, who is mighty in power as well to puniſh the obſtinate, as to reward the obedient. 3 He termeth himſelfe <hi>a ielous God,</hi> that is a moſt ſharp de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of his owne honour; woonderfully diſpleaſed with ſuch as reuolt from him, or violate and impaire his honour and worſhip. Now ſeeing ielouſie or indignation concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for any iniury, or diſhoneſty, ariſeth from his loue which is hurt, God dooth hereby withall ſignifie that hee
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:19538:454"/>
doth ardently and entirely loue thoſe who are his. 4 <hi>Hee calleth himſelfe a god, which viſiteth the ſinnes of the fathers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him.</hi> Whereby he exaggerateth or encreaſeth the grieuouſneſſe of his anger and their puniſhments, when he threatneth alſo and denounceth vnto the children, and to the childrens children, and to the childrens childrens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his enimies, euen to the fourth degree and diſcent, to take vengeaunce on the ſinnes of their aunceſtours in them, if namely they alſo partake with the ſinnes of their anceſtours.</p>
               <p>But to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mination or denouncement the ſaying of Ezechiel, cap. 18. ſeemeth to be repugnaunt. <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhal die. The Sonne ſhal not beare the iniquitie of the Father, neither ſhall the Father bear the iniquitie of the Sonne.</hi> But in the ſame place is added a reconcilement of theſe two places of Scripture: <hi>Jf a wicked man beget a Sonne, that ſeeth al his fathers ſinnes, which he hath done and feareth, neither doth the like, he ſhal not die in the iniquitie of his father, but ſhal ſurelie liue.</hi> Hee threatneth then, that he wil puniſh the ſins of the aunceſtours in their poſterity, that is, ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the ſinnes of their aunceſtors, whom it is meete and iuſt to be partakers alſo of their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>If any man reply; <hi>That by this means the poſteritie rue onlie their owne ſinnes, and not the ſinnes alſo of their aunceſtours:</hi> this replie is falſe and of no conſequence. For there may be, and are oftentimes moe impellent and motiue cauſes of one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the cauſe of one puniſhment are mo ſinnes as wel of diuerſe, as of the ſame men. If further it bee vrged; <hi>that vengeance is not taken on the aunceſtours ſinnes in the poſteritie becauſe the ſenſe and feeling of thoſe paines, which the poſteritie ſuffer, reacheth not to the aunceſtours:</hi> we aunſwere firſt, that the poſteritie are a part of their anceſtours, of whom they came: And therefore that is felt of them, as it were in ſome part of them, which their poſterity ſuffer. Secondly, we ſay that the aunceſtours are tormented and vexed, when they vnderſtand or ſee their ofspring in this life and in the life to come to bee afflicted. Thirdly, wee ſaie, that beſides the feeling or fellowſhip of griefe, the puniſhment of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie doth belong vnto them by a relation: in as much as
<pb n="891" facs="tcp:19538:454"/>
god pronounceth that hee therefore dooth inflict this on the poſteritie, that thereby he maie teſtifie, how greatly he is angrie and offended both with the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſinnes, and with the ſinnes of their anceſtours. 5. He ſaith that he is a god, which <hi>ſheweth mercie vnto thouſandes in them that loue him and keepe his commaundementes. And heere hee extendeth his puniſhment vnto the fourth generation, but his mercy vnto thouſandes,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſignifie, that he had rather ſhewe mercy than anger: and ſo by this meanes to allure vs the more to loue him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But vnto this promiſe are oppoſed manie examples of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, whoſe children and poſteritie haue periſhed.</hi> Whereunto god himſelf anſwereth, <hi>Eze.</hi> 18. <hi>That he wil bleſſe the poſterity of the godly if they continue in the good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation &amp; godlines of their aunceſtours: but wil puniſh them, if they depart from it.</hi> If here it be demaunded, <hi>why hee dooth not conuert their poſteritie, ſeeing without his mercy they are not able to follow the godlines of their parentes.</hi> We anſwere firſt, <hi>Becauſe this promiſe is not vniuerſal but indefinite, and therefore God doth not therein bind his mercie vnto euerie particular one of the godlies poſteritie, but reſerueth his Election free vnto himſelfe:</hi> So that as of the poſteritie of the wicked he conuerteth and ſaueth ſome, in like manner alſo he leaueth of the poſterity of the godly ſome in their naturall corruption, and in deſtruction, which all by nature deſerue: and this he doth, to ſhew, that his mercy is free, as wel in chuſing the poſterity of the godly, as of the wicked. Secondly, <hi>becauſe he bindeth not himſelfe to perfourme the ſame benefites or all the benefites vnto all the poſteritie of the godlie.</hi> Wherefore he ſatisfieth this promiſe, when he dooth euen vouchſafe of corporall benefites the wicked and reprobate poſterity of the godly. Thirdly, <hi>becauſe he promiſeth this feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the poſteritie vnto them that loue him, and keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandmentes,</hi> that is, to thoſe which are indeede godly, and of good conuerſation. But becauſe the loue of God &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is euen in the holieſt Saintes in this life vnperfect: therefore the reward alſo promiſed vnto them is vnperfect and ioined with the croſſe &amp; chaſtiſements, among which the wickedneſſe and vnhappineſſe of their poſteritie is not the laſt; as maie appear in Dauid, Salomon, and Ioſias.</p>
               <p>Obiection. <hi>They who keepe Gods commaundementes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mercie. Therefore we merit ſomewhat of God.</hi> Aunſwere.
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:19538:455"/>
God ſaith, <hi>J wil ſhew the mercie</hi> Therefore it is not of merit or deſert. Therefore the obiection is a fallacy, putting that for a cauſe which is no cauſe. For when God addeth this promiſe, <hi>that he will ſhewe mercie vnto the thouſand generation of them that loue him and keepe his commaundements,</hi> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he had rather ſhew mercy, than anger, thereby to allure vs to loue him.</p>
               <p>This promiſe and commination is belonging verily to the obedience of the whole Decalogue, but is therefore eſpecially annexed vnto this commaundement, both that we might know the firſt and ſecond commandement, to be the foundation of al the reſt, &amp; alſo that God might ſhew that he is eſpecially angry with the deprauers and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his worſhip, and puniſheth this kinde of ſin both in them and in their poſterity; and contrarily doth bleſſe alſo the poſterity of them which diligently regard and keepe pure religion, or the true ſeruice and worſhip of God. By this declaration and expoſition of the woords of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, it appeareth that by the naming of one kind, al falſe worſhips of God are condemned: and contrariwiſe, is commaunded the obſeruation of the true and vncorrupt worſhippe, which is euery internal or external work, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of God, doone in faith, which is perſuaded that both the perſon and the woork pleaſe God for the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſake; the chiefe end where of is, that due honour may be giuen vnto god, whereby we may ſhew, that we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him alone for the tru god, who hath willed this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be thus done to him. And then is this worſhip done vnto him, when he is ſo worſhipped, as himſelfe hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in his word that he will be worſhipped. And theſe may ſuffice as touching the exhortation which is adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the commaundement; nowe wil wee declare thoſe things which belong vnto the commandement it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>In this ſecond commaundement is forbidden, <hi>all falſe worſhip; and the true worſhip of God is commaunded.</hi> And this is the end or ſcope of this commaundement, <hi>that the true god alone, who commaundeth himſelfe to bee worſhipped in the firſt commaundement, bee rightlie worſhipped of vs,</hi> namely with ſuch worſhip, wherewith it is right and meete he ſhould be worſhipped of intelligent or vnderſtanding creatures, and
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:19538:455"/>
ſuch as pleaſeth him. God therefore in this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſcribeth the rule of true diuine worſhips. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not only that creatures or Images be not reputed or woorſhipped for God, but alſo that himſelfe be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by Images, and at Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he condemneth the chiefe, and groſſeſt, and moſt euident kinde of falſe woorſhippes, namely the woorſhipping of God at or by Images, it is manifeſt that hee forbideth alſo the other kindes of falſe woorſhippes, ſeeing this is the heade and fountaine of all the reſt. Wherefore all woorſhippes, whatſoeuer are inſtituted by men, not by God, &amp; in which the ſame cauſe of prohibiting or forbidding appeareth, are forbidden by the forbidding of this the groſſeſt kinde of the reſt, and withall a rule is giuen, that wee holily and religiouſly conteine and holde our ſelues within the liſts and tarriers preſcribed by God, neither ad ought to that woorſhippe which God himſelfe hath inſtituted,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 1.7.

And this ſtudie, endeuour, and care to worſhip God after that manner, which himſelfe hath commanded, is the poper &amp; peculiar obedience of this commaundement; Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo required in theſe ſayings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4 <hi>Ye ſhal put nothing to the word which I command you, neither ſhal ye take ought therefrom; that yee may keepe the commaundementes of the Lorde your God which I command you.</hi> Deutr. 12. <hi>Whatſoeuer J command you, take heed you do it: thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom.</hi>

So prone and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is our nature vnto this euill, which hath after enſuing it moſt grieuous puniſhments, as are thoſe which the Lord reciteth by Moſes, beſides many others: <hi>I wil deſtroy,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>your high places, and cut awaie your Jmages, and caſt your carkaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vpon the bodies of your Idoles, and my ſoule ſhal abhor you.</hi> In like manner alſo the Angel of the Lord vpbraiding the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites that they had made a league with the Idolatrous Cananites, ſaith; <hi>Wherefore I will not caſt them out before you, but they ſhall bee as thornes vnto your ſides, and their gods ſhall be your deſtruction.</hi> It is no ceremony therefore to aboliſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; ſeeing they are the inſtruments, ſignes, cauſes, and occaſions of Idolatry. Neither are the cauſes of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement any way chaunged or diminiſhed, as namelie that the glory of god be maintained againſt Idolaters and the enemies of the church, and that god bee not tempted through offering an occaſion of ſuperſtition, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing falſe and corrupt opinions of gods worſhip, vnto men, which are of their owne accord inclining and prone vnto idolatry. Wherefore this commaundement of taking away and aboliſhing images made for the repreſenting of god, or for diuine worſhippe, is Moral, and dureth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuallie.</p>

For the Prophetes teach far otherwiſe: as, <hi>Haba</hi> 2.18. <hi>An image is a teacher of lies.</hi> Zacha. 10.2. <hi>The Jdoles haue ſpoken vanitie. Whence we maie thus reaſon. We ought not to ſpeak vain things, or to lie of God either in words or in geſtures.

If then we wil not lie of god, we muſt needs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make nor haue anie Images or grauen ſemblances.</hi> For as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie ſaith, 10.8. <hi>The ſtock is a doctrine of vanitie.</hi> Nowe in this ſenſe we graunt Images to be the books of the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: to witte, becauſe partly they teach and ſignifie falſe things of God; and partly becauſe through the reuerence of the thing ſignified and the place, when as they ſtand to the open view in churches and elſewhere, they eaſily draw

away others vnto ſuperſtition, and teach the people Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as experience, ſufficiently beareth witnes. 3. It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not, if it were ſo that Images did teach the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that therefore they ſhould be reteined in the church, as profitable books.

Laſtly, thoſe viſible ſhapes continued ſo long, as it pleaſed the Lord to vſe them for to manifeſt and ſhew himſelfe; and therefore could they not bee draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Idolatry; But Images and pictures, which men make to repreſent the manifeſtations of god, were neither or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to manifeſt god, nor to repreſent or reſemble

                  <p>THIS part forbiddeth any worſhippe to be giuen vnto Images, not only that which is giuen thereby or refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to creatures, but that alſo which is referred vnto god himſelfe. Obiection. 1. <hi>The honour which is giuen vnto the ſign is the honour of the thing ſignified: Images are a ſigne of God. Therfore the honor which is giuen vnto Images is alſo giuen vnto God.</hi> Anſ. The honour of the ſigne is alſo the honour of the thing ſignified, namely when the ſign is a true ſign, that is, ordained by him who hath autority to ordain it, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that honour is giuen vnto the ſign, which the right and lawfull author of it willeth to be doone vnto the ſigne. For not the will of him that honoureth, but of him that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured is the rule which muſt preſcribe the due honour.

dependeth of that, according to which the ſubiect is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; not of ſome other thing.

For to the ſhewing of deſpite and contumely againſt god it ſufficeth if there bee any intent or purpoſe of departing from his commaundement. But if through a deſire that we haue to auoide Idolatry we deteſt Images, and other falſe reputed ſignes of god, by this contumely doone vnto the ſignes, we rather promote further &amp; aduaunce gods glory.

For they belong either to the keeping and maintaining of order and comelines in Church-aſſemblies and in the Eccleſiaſtical admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the miniſterie; or to externall exerciſes of godlines, both publique and priuate, or to auoide the giuing of offence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the weaker, &amp; to bring them vnto the Church and knowledge of the truth:</hi> Of which kind are, the time, place, form, &amp; courſe of ſermons, &amp; prayers, &amp; readings in the Church, likewiſe faſtes, the manner of proceeding in election of miniſters, in gathering and diſtributing almes, and ſuch like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of god hath commaunded nothing in ſpeciall. <hi>The generall alſo of theſe Lawes, as of the ciuil, is moral,</hi> if they be rightlie &amp; profitably made, <hi>and therefore is it the worſhip of God:</hi> as it is gods worſhip, to heare the woord of god, to pray vnto god as wel publiquely with the company of the faithfull, as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, to beſtowe almes vpon our poore brethren, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſacramentes. <hi>But the Ceremonies themſelues are not onelie no worſhip of God, but neither doe they binde mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, neither is the obſeruation of them neceſſarie, except the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of them breede offence.</hi> So it is no worſhip of god, but a thing indifferent, and not binding mens conſcience, to vſe this or that forme of praier, at this or that time, at this or that houre, in this or that place to heare the woorde of god, to pray, to receiue the ſacraments. Neither hath the Church onely this right and power to conſtitute or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or alter by her owne authoritie theſe ordinances, as ſhe iudgeth it to be moſt expedient for her common edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but the conſciences alſo of particular men reteine this libertie, ſo that they may either omit theſe or doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe without any offence againſt god, if there ariſe no
<pb n="905" facs="tcp:19538:461"/>
ſcandal or offence thereby among men, that is, if they doe it neither of contempt, or neglect of the miniſterie, nor of wantonnes, or ambition, or of a deſire of contention &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, nor with the offending of weake ones. The reaſon is, <hi>becauſe then lawes are rightlie obſerued, when they are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued according to the mind and purpoſe of the law-giuer.</hi> But the Church ought to will that ſuch ordinances and ſtatutes as are made concerning thinges indifferent bee obſerued, not in reſpect of her owne authoritie or commaundement, but onely for the maintenance of order and comlineſſe, and for the auoiding of ſcandals and offences. Wherefore as long as comlineſſe or order is not violated, neither offence giuen, it leaueth euerie mans conſcience free to himſelfe. For not in reſpect of the Churches or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters commandement, but in reſpect of the iuſt cauſes of commaunding, thinges indifferent are neceſſarily ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be done, or to bee omitted; and the conſcience is hurt not by the neglect of any humane commaundement, as in ciuill matters, but by the neglect of the cauſes for which they are commaunded. Hither belongeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Saint Paul, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27. <hi>Jf anie of them which beleeue not, call you vnto a feaſt, and if yee will goe, whatſoeuer is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you eate, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake. But if anie man ſaie vnto you, this is ſacrificed vnto Jdoles, eate it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him that ſhewed it, and for the conſcience (for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is) And the conſcience I ſaie, not thine, but of that other: For why ſhould my libertie be condemned of another mans conſcience? For if J thorough Gods benefite bee partaker, why am I euill ſpoken of, for that wherefore J giue thankes?</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>the Decree of the councell of the Apoſtles,</hi> Acts. 15. <hi>Of thinges ſacrificed to Jdols, of bloude, and that which was ſtrangled.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>the precept giuen concerning women to be couered.</hi> 1.

               <p>Reply. <hi>If the edictes of Magiſtrates binde mens conſciences, why then doe not the traditions of the Church bind them alſo?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. God gaue this power and authority of making ciuill lawes vnto the Magiſtrate, and hath ſtrengthened it with this band, in that hee threatneth and denounceth his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="906" facs="tcp:19538:462"/>
againſt them which breake theſe lawes: but vnto the Church and to his Miniſters hee hath not giuen any ſuch authoritie; but yet notwithſtanding hee would haue theſe lawes and conſtitutions to bee obſerued, which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters &amp; the Church of their own authoritie command, not for any neceſſity that there is of obeying theſe lawes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Church, but according to the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that is, for a deſire of auoiding offence. This aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is deliuered in theſe places of ſcripture. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Yee knowe that the Lordes of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and they that are great, exerciſe authoritie ouer them: But it ſhall not bee ſo among you; but whoſoeuer will bee great among you, let him be your ſeruaunt.</hi> 1. Pet. 5.3. <hi>Not as if ye were Lordes ouer Gods heritage, but that yee maie be enſamples to the flocke.</hi> Coloſ. 2.16. <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate and drinke, or in reſpect of an Holie-daie, or of the newe Moone, or of the Sabboth daies.</hi> Gal. 5.1. <hi>Stand faſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free.</hi> Neither are the cauſes obſcure or harde to come by, for which God made this difference: namely, <hi>that there might bee an euident difference betweene the ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, vnto whom it belongeth to beare rule ouer his ſubiects, and to conſtrain by corporall force ſuch as obeie not; and the Miniſters of the Church, vnto whom no ſuch rule and power is graunted;</hi> but vnto them is committed the charge and office of teaching and inſtructing men concerning the will of GOD. Againe, <hi>becauſe by the breach of Eccleſiaſticall lawes, if it bee done without giuing of offence, the firſt table of the Decalogue, for which they are to ſerue, is not broken: but by the breach of ciuil lawes, albeit no offence be giuen thereby, the ſecond table is broken,</hi> in as much as either ſome thing is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common wealth, or ſome occaſion is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iniurying it. Neither is this replie of force; <hi>That vnto the greater and worthier office greater obedience is due: And therefore the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Miniſters of the Church are no leſſe neceſſarilie to bee kept, than the lawes of the ciuil Magiſtrate.</hi> For vnto the worthier greater obedience is due in thoſe thinges which are properly belonging vnto his office. Now <hi>the proper office of the ciuil Magiſtrate is,</hi> to make lawes which are for the commaundement it ſelfe to bee obſerued: but the proper office of the miniſterie of the Church is, to ſound foorth
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:19538:462"/>
Gods commaundements: And <hi>the proper office of the Church is,</hi> to ordaine Ceremoniall decrees, which muſt bee kept, not for the commaundement of man, but for auoiding of offences.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Humane ordinances, which are repugnant vnto the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God.</hi> Theſe God forbiddeth vs to obey, whether the ciuil Magiſtrate commaunde them, or the Church, or the Miniſters of the Church. <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.29. <hi>We ought rather to obey God than Men.</hi> Matth. 15.3. <hi>Why tranſgreſſe yee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of god by your tradition?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hauing now conſidered theſe foure kindes of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deliuered by men, it is eaſie to make aunſwere vnto that firſt obiection; <hi>God commaundeth vs to obey the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of men.</hi> He doth ſo, firſt, <hi>Such as bee good, that is, not repugnant vnto his woorde.</hi> Secondly, <hi>ſuch as hee himſelfe hath commaunded by men, that worſhip maie be giuen him.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Ciuil ordinances which depend on the authoritie of men, not obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for diuine worſhippe, but for conſcience, ſake:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Eccleſiaſticall or Ceremonial ordinances, obeying them, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting therein anie diuine worſhippe, or conſcience, (neither of which they import) but onelie the auoiding of offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Obie. <hi>What things the church commandeth by the inſtinct of the holie ghoſt, thoſe are diuine ordinances belonging to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of god. But the church decreeth good and profitable conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being guided by the guiding of the holie ghoſt: Therefore good conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s decreed by the church appertaine to the worſhip of god.</hi> Aunſwere. The general indeede of thoſe commandements, which the church preſcribeth by the inſtinct of the holie Ghoſt, appertaineth to the worſhip of God. This general compriſeth the diuine Lawes of God, of not breaking cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of auoiding offence, of keeping order and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the church. And in reſpect of this general, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, which the church decreeth by the inſtinct and motion of the holy Ghoſt, are alſo diuine, or the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, as namely they are a part of theſe diuine Lawes, the care and keeping whereof is commended vnto vs by god himſelfe in his word. But thoſe good conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the church are humane, or the conſtitutions of men as they doe in ſpeciall deſigne that which was in generall by theſe diuine Lawes ſignified rather than expounded.
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:19538:463"/>
Wherefore thoſe ordinances are no worſhip of god, which the church aduiſeth, decreeth, receiueth or commaundeth for the countenaunce of mutual charity among vs, and for the preſeruation of order and comelineſſe, or for the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of offences, albeit in the chooſing and conſtituting of theſe ſhee be directed by the inſtinct of the holy ghoſt. For the holy ghoſt declareth both vnto the church; both what is profitable for the auoiding of offences, and alſo that thoſe things, which are commaunded for the auoiding of offences, are neither the worſhip of god, nor neceſſary to be obſerued, but in caſe of auoiding offence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the church reteineth her libertie of deliberating of them, or of chaunging of them, or of omitting them, if there be no feare of offence. This doth Saint Paul mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare, when as, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. counſelling them to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, which haue the gift of continency, yet hee addeth further: But I ſpeak this by permiſſion, not by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Again, <hi>This J ſpeake for your owne commoditie, not to tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle you in a ſnare, but that yee followe that which is honeſt, and that ye cleaue faſt vnto the Lord without ſeparation.</hi> Here he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth both; both that hee wiſheth them, that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, to leade a ſingle life, that ſo they may the more fitlie ſerue god; and that alſo hee leaueth it free vnto them to marry, and hee ſpeaketh both by the inſtinct of the holie ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Obiection. <hi>God is worſhipped by thoſe thinges, which are done to Gods glory. The things that the Church doth decree are don to Gods glorie. Therefore theſe alſo are the worſhip of God.</hi> Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Thoſe thinges, that are done to the glory of god, by themſelues, that is, which are commaunded by god, to this end, as that by theſe workes wee ſhould declare our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towardes him, they are the worſhippe of god: but not thoſe thinges which ſerue for the glorie of god but by an accident, that is, which ſerue ſometimes for the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of thoſe thinges, which are commanded by god, vpon ſome accidental reſpectes and cauſes, which if they do not concur, god yet may be honored both of thoſe that do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of thoſe that doe them not, ſo that they be done, or left vndoone, of faith, which is aſſured and reſolueth, that the perſon is not reconciled vnto god, and that the action, or
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:19538:463"/>
omitting of the action doth agree with the word of god.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Obiection. <hi>The examples of thoſe who haue worſhipped God without his direct commandement, confirme that it is permitted to men to worſhip God with that worſhip which themſelues ordaine.</hi> Aunſ. The example of Samuel ſacrificing in Ramoth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at al eſtabliſh <hi>Wil-worſhip.</hi> For as touching the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they were the worſhip of god, becauſe they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by god: and as concerning the places appointed for ſacrifices, they were free, when as yet there was no appointed place for the arke of the couenaunt. Wherefore Samuel did appoint that towne for ſacrifices, where hee dwelt, as being moſt fit and commodious. Verie wel knewe the holy Prophet that the woorſhip of God did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this circumſtaunce of place, which was left free vnto the godly before the temple was built of Salomon. Laſtly as concerning the perſon, although the Prophets were not of Aarons family, yet had they by reaſon of their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary function autority to ſacrifice. This alſo may be ſaid as touching Elias ſacrificing in the mount Carmel. Now as for Manoah who is ſaid to ſacrifice in Zorah, either he did not himſelfe ſacrifice, but deliuered the ſacrifice to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Angel, whom hee tooke to be a Prophet, or hee himſelfe offered it being commanded by the Angell, and ſo did nothing beſides the diuine Lawe of god.</p>
               <p>In like manner is the aunſwere eaſie to other examples which they heap together &amp; bring in. <hi>Abel &amp; Noah,</hi> Gen. 4. and 8. <hi>offer ſacrifice:</hi> but not without the commandement of god, becauſe they did it with faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. But no faith can bee without the woord of god, <hi>Roman.</hi> 10. <hi>The Recha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> Ier. 35. <hi>refraine from wine and husbandrie according to their father Ionadabs commaundement, and are therefore by God commended:</hi> But Ionadab meant not to inſtitute any newe worſhip of god, but by this ciuil ordinaunce to baniſh from his poſterity riot and ſuch ſinnes and puniſhmentes as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company riot. So alſo <hi>Daniels faſting,</hi> Dan. 10. <hi>&amp; the Nineuits faſting,</hi> Ion. 3. was no worſhip of god, but an exerciſe, ſeruing for the ſtirring vp of praier and repentaunce, which were that worſhip of God which is in thoſe places commended, Now <hi>in Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (Matth. 3.) not his kind of liuing, foode, and apparel, but his ſobriety, and temperancy is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:19538:464"/>
&amp; is the worſhip of god. And, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. not the raiment made of ſheepes and goates skins, neither the wandring in mountaines, caues, and dens, but faith and patience in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities is ſet forth and commended as the worſhippe of god.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Obiection. <hi>Whatſoeuer is done of faith, and pleaſeth god, is Gods worſhip: Theſe works, albeit they are vndertaken by men voluntarily, yet are done of faith, and pleaſe God. Therefore theſe workes vndertaken by men voluntarily, are the worſhippe of God.</hi> Aunſwere. This doth not ſuffice for the defining gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: for after a diuerſe ſort is the worſhippe or god, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions pleaſing vnto god. The worſhippe of god doth ſo pleaſe god, that the contrary there to diſpleaſeth god: &amp; therefore cannot be done of faith. But thoſe things which are in themſelues indifferent, are ſo liked of god, that their contraries alſo are not of him diſliked or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>

                  <hi>To take the name of the Lord,</hi> or to name or vſe the name of the Lord, God verily doth not forbid; but he forbiddeth to vſe it falſlie or vainely.

                     <hi>AN oath is an inuocating on god, whereby is deſired that god, who is the viewer of the harts, would bee a witneſſe vnto him that ſweareth, that he wil not lie or deceiue in that matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſweareth, and that God would puniſh him that ſweareth, if he doe lie or deceiue.</hi> In this definition are the other foure que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions alſo comprehended. <hi>Furthermore an oath was ordained by God, that it might be the bond of truth betweene men, and a teſtimonie or recorde, that god is the authour and defender of the truth.</hi> An oath is oftentimes vnderſtoode and taken for the

                     <hi>WE muſt ſweare by god onlie.</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>god hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to ſweare by him onlie,</hi> as he alone is to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and worſhipped. 2. <hi>God wil haue inuocation to be vſed vnto himſelfe onelie:</hi> Therefore hee will haue vs to ſweare alſo by himſelfe only, becauſe an oath is an inuocating on god. 3. <hi>An oath doth giue and aſcribe vnto him, by whom wee ſweare, the inſpection and viewing of mens hearts, the hearing of them, and infinite wiſedome and knowledge.</hi> But God onely is the viewer of our hearts. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Hee knewe what was in man.</hi> 4. <hi>By whom wee ſweare, vnto him we giue and aſcribe the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of puniſhment, and omnipotencie, as whereby he muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the truth, and puniſh him that lieth:</hi> But God alone is omnipotent and executour of puniſhment. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Feare ye not them which kill the bodie, but are not able to kill the ſoule: but rather feare him, which is able to deſtroie both ſoule and bodie in hell.</hi> Wherefore we may not ſweare by any but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God, and therefore ſuch oathes as are ſworne by Saintes are idolatrous, and forbidden of God.</p>

                     <hi>OATHES conceiued or made rightlie of thinges lawfull, true, certaine, waightie, and poſſible, are to be kept.</hi> For if once thou haſt acknowledged and teſtified thy ſelfe to bee iuſtly bound to keepe thy promiſe, and haſt called god to record hereof, when as afterwards thou wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly breakeſt thine oath, thou doeſt violate and breake a iuſt bonde, and doeſt either accuſe god, the witnes and maintainer of this bond, of vanity and lightnes, or prouoke him to puniſh thee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.5. <hi>He that ſweareth to his owne hinderance and changeth not, ſhall neuer be moued.</hi> Numb. 30.3. <hi>Whoſoeuer voweth a vowe vnto the Lord, or ſweareth an oath to bind himſelfe by bond, hee ſhall not breake his promiſe, but ſhall doe according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But oathes that are male of vnlawful thinges, either by an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or by ignoraunce, or through infirmitie, or againſt the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is ſinne to keepe them.</hi> And therefore ſuch oaths are to be retracted and recalled, leaſt we adde thereby ſinnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinnes. For <hi>he that keepeth an oath made of vnlawful things, heapeth ſinne vpon ſinne, both in that he ſware, and ſo hath a wil to ſinne, and alſo in that he endeuoureth to do that which he ſware,</hi> and ſo confirmeth that will of ſinning by an oath. For what thinges GOD forbiddeth, thoſe thinges hee will not haue men either ſworne or vnſworne to perfourme: and what hee forbiddeth vs to will, or promiſe, or ſweare, ſo much the more doth hee forbidde vs to doe the ſame, how much the more grieuous a thing it is to doe them, than to will or promiſe them. They therefore who keep that which they haue ill ſworne, heape ſinne vnto ſinne; as did Herod putting Iohn Baptiſt to death by pretence of keeping his oath: and likewiſe ſuch as keepe monaſtical vowes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue ſworne Idolatrie, and impious ſingle liuing. Neither is this argument of any force: <hi>An oath is neceſſarilie to be kept, but they haue ſworne theſe thinges: therefore they muſt needes keepe them.</hi> For the Maior is true of a lawfull oath. But an oath, which is made of a thing forbidden by god, is not to be kept: becauſe it is not a lawful oath; which alſo is
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:19538:468"/>
amended and corrected by repenting thereof, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting from an euil purpoſe, not by perſiſting therein, or by perfourming it: according as it is ſaide, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteale no more;</hi> and according to the example and doctrine of Dauid, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. who ſweareth that hee will deſtroy Nabal together with his familie, Saying: <hi>So and more alſo doe God vnto the enimies of Dauid; for ſurelie J wil not leaue of all that he hath, by the dawning of the daie, anie that piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againſt the wall:</hi> But after hee had heard Abigail ſpeake, he giueth thankes to god, that the executing and fulfilling of his oath was hindered by her, and confirmeth by a new oath, that this is gods bleſſing and benefite, ſaying: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Jſraell which ſent thee this daie to meete mee; and bleſſed be thy counſels, and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me this daie from comming to ſhed bloud, and that mine hand hath not ſaued mee. For indeede, as the Lord God of Iſrael liueth, who hath kept me backe from hurting thee &amp;c.</hi> Obiection. 1. <hi>He that ſweareth to doe a thing, which is in his power to doe, and yet dooth it not, maketh God witnes of a lie.</hi> Anſwere. He that ſweareth indeede ought that is lawfull and is in his power, and doth it not, maketh god witnes of a lie: but if it be an euil thing which he ſweareth, the recalling thereof is better than the keeping. Obiection 2. <hi>The oath of peace which was made to the Gibeonites,</hi> Iohn. 9. <hi>was againſt the commaundement of God. Jt is lawful therefore to keepe an oath made of thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi> Aunſwere. 1. They were not excluded from peace if anie of thoſe Nations, which God hath commaunded to be deſtroyed, did aske peace of the Iſraelites, and did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their religion. Now the Gibeonites deſire peace, and are adiudged to ſerue the tabernacle for woodcleauers and drawers of water perpetually. Therefore the peace which was promiſed them, albeit it was obteined by fraude and guile, yet was it not repugnant to Gods commaundment. 2. The Iſraelites doe not therefore keepe this oath, as that they were bound thereby, becauſe they ſware it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and thinking the Gibeonites to haue beene of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other countrie: but firſt <hi>for auoiding of offence,</hi> whereby the name of God might bee diſgraced among the Heathen, if the Iewes had not kept their oath. and then, <hi>becauſe it was lawful and iuſt to ſaue them, which deſired peace, and embraced
<pb n="919" facs="tcp:19538:468"/>
their religion, although no oath had beene made at all.</hi>

                  <p>Out of thoſe thinges which haue beene ſpoken <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the keeping of lawful oathes,</hi> aunſwere is made vnto this queſtion, <hi>Whether oathes extorted from men againſt their wils are to be kept.</hi> Extorted oathes <hi>are to bee kept, if they containe nothing in them that is vnlawfull, or if they haue the forealleaged conditions,</hi> although they be vnprofitable and hurtful to vs. <hi>But vnto wicked oathes no man ought to be forced: neither verilie ſhould wicked oathes be extorted by anie tortures from vs, but we muſt chooſe to die rather. But if anie wicked and impious oathes be made, through feare or infirmitie, againſt our conſcience, thoſe doe not bind, and are to bee recalled; becauſe what is impious to be done, that is impious to be ſworne; neither is one ſinne to be heaped on another. Now extorted oathes, that are not impious, which are made of things lawful and poſſible, though hurtfull and harde, are doubtleſſe to be kept, becauſe thou art bound by Gods Law to chuſe the leſſer euil.</hi> If it bee iuſt to doe, which thou through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint haſt promiſed, it is iuſt alſo for thee to promiſe by oath to doe it. For what we may lawfully doe, the ſame alſo we may lawfully promiſe by an oath to do. As, if a man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of a theef, ſhuld be required by the thief to giue a peece of mony for the redeeming of his life; verily he not only may, but alſo ought, if he be able, to perfourme that which the theef requireth. And if this be lawfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto a theef, it is lawfully alſo performed vnto him by an oath. Likewiſe, it is lawful alſo to promiſe by oath ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence vnto the theefe, and ſuch an oath made for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of ſilence promiſed vnto the theefe, both may, and ought to be kept.</p>
                  <p>Obiection. <hi>That which is hurtful vnto the common wealth, is not to be promiſed, or if it haue been promiſed, it is not to be kept: Such ſilence promiſed vnto the theefe is hurtfull to the common wealth: therefore it is not to be promiſed, or if it haue beene promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is not to be kept.</hi> Aunſwere. 1. That which is hurtfull to the common wealth is not to bee promiſed, that is, if wee may doe it without the hazard and danger of our life; And further, if at that inſtant, when a man is in ſuch daunger of his life, hee bee not rather to prouide for his owne ſafety, than to reueile ſuch a thing. 2. It is rather profitable than hurtful vnto the common wealth to promiſe ſilence vnto
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:19538:469"/>
the theefe, and to keepe promiſe. For hee, which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſilence by oath vnto the theefe, is by this meanes ſaued. Moreouer if he ſhould not promiſe by oath ſilence vnto the theefe threatning him death, he ſhoulde thereby neither profit the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, nor himſelf. Wherefore to promiſe ſilence by oath vnto the theef, &amp; to keepe it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the leſſer euil, is of the two rather to be choſen.</p>

The ſecond reaſon is drawen <hi>from the definition or nature of an oath; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an oath is a teſtification of the truth, and an inuocation of God, whereby we deſire of God ſuch thinges as are agreeable vnto his nature and wil manifeſted in his word, to wit, that he wil bear record vnto the truth.</hi> But this inuocation of God is lawfull: therefore an oath is lawful.

                  <p>Theſe and the like examples doe ſufficiently ſhew, <hi>that it is graunted doubtleſſe vnto Chriſtians to take a iuſt oath in lawful matters.</hi> Wherefore <hi>all thoſe places of Scripture, which ſeeme to forbid oathes, forbidde raſh oathes, or ſuch as haue not thoſe lawful cauſes and conditions of an oath:</hi> Which alſo is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by comparing the places of the old and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the end and drift of Chriſt, who went about to free the lawe from the corruptions of the Phariſees. Whereupon in S. Matthew. cap. 5. raſhe and vnneceſſary oathes are forbidden: and this to be ſo, is manifeſt both by conference of other places, and alſo by the purpoſe and ſcope of Chriſt, who (as it was ſaide) freeing the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſentence of the lawe from the corruptions of the Phariſees, ſheweth that by the third commaundement are condemned all oathes, ſuperfluous, and vnneceſſarie: and in them not onely thoſe that are direct oathes, in which the name it ſelfe of God is expreſſed, but alſo indirect or oblique oathes, in which the name of God is vnderſtoode being diſſembled and cloaked by vttering in place thereof the names of creatures. And ſo he taxeth the hypocriſie of the Phariſies, who did exerciſe thoſe indirect or oblique formes of ſwearing, as if they did not ſeeme by raſh ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to prophane the name of God, if they expreſſed not the name of god in their oath; and as if they were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured and forſworne, if when they expreſſed not the name of God in their oath, they afterwards breake their faith &amp; oath giuen in that indirect forme of ſwearing. But Chriſt ſheweth, <hi>that euen then alſo the name of GOD is ſworne by, when heauen and earth is named,</hi> becauſe there is no part of the worlde, wherein God hath not engrauen a marke of
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:19538:470"/>
his glorie. And when men ſweare by heauen and earth, in the ſight and hearing of the framer of them both, the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the oath is not in the creatures by whom they ſweare, but God himſelfe only is called to record, and for a witneſſe, by the citing of theſe ſymboles and badges of his glorie. Neither doth God ſticke in the wordes; but in the ſentence and meaning rather, than in the ſignes and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles doth the honour or diſhonour of Gods name conſiſt: like as Chriſt alſo teacheth the ſame in expreſſe woordes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. which wordes are to be inferred with this place which now we haue expounded. Obiection. <hi>But Chriſt ſaith, ſweare not at all.</hi> Anſ. That, <hi>At all,</hi> is referred to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers formes of ſwearing, not to the very word of ſwearing it ſelfe: as if they ſhould ſay, ſweare not falſly or raſhly at al, to wit, neither directly, nor indirectly. <hi>For he that ſweareth by the Temple, by Heauen, by Earth,</hi> affirmeth thoſe thinges which he auoucheth, to be as true, as the temple is truely Gods houſe, heauen Gods ſeate, and earth his footſtoole. And this is all one, as if he ſhould ſweare by the life of god. For he prouoketh God to defend and maintain his honor, in puniſhing him that ſweareth, if hee deceiue and ſpeake falſlie. Obiection. <hi>The taking of an oath belongeth onlie to a publicke oath, not to a priuate oath.</hi> Anſwere. 1. This is a falſe reſtraint, becauſe thoſe things which the Scripture deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth concerning an oath, are not reſtrained to a publicke oath only, yea a great part of them prooue and conuince, <hi>that a right &amp; iuſt oath is no leſſe allowable in Chriſtians priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, than publickelie,</hi> as by the verie teſtimonies themſelues of ſacred Scripture is ſufficiently declared. 2. <hi>The examples of holie men,</hi> affirming the trueth by priuate oath, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their faith priuatlie vnto others, do likewiſe manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare that a priuate oath alſo being rightly made and conceiued is allowable in Chriſtians. 3 The ſame is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alſo, <hi>by the end of an oath:</hi> for the end thereof is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of faith and trueth, and the deciding of debates belongeth priuatly alſo to all Chriſtians, and therefore ſo doth an oath it ſelfe alſo, whereby we confirme &amp; eſtabliſh faith and trueth.</p>
                  <p>Vnto the parts of the obedience of this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are oppoſed thoſe ſinnes, whereby either the right
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:19538:470"/>
taking and vſing of Gods name is omitted, or the ill and vaine vſing and taking thereof committed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnto the propagation of the doctrine concerning God is oppoſed, an omiſſion or neglect of occaſions and abilitie to inſtruct others, and to bring them vnto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> eſpeciallie our children, or others, who are committed vnto our truſt and charge. Hither belongeth Chriſts parable of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes employing their Maiſters talentes in trafique, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Vnto this is alſo oppoſed <hi>A lothing or ſhunning of ſuch talk &amp; ſpeech as is had of God and diuine matters.</hi> Pſ. 119. <hi>I wil delite in thy ſtatutes, &amp; wil not forget thy words.</hi> And in the ſame Pſalme: <hi>Saluation is farre from the wicked, becauſe they ſeeke not after thy Lawes.</hi> Vnto this alſo are oppoſed <hi>the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of religion and of heauenlie doctrine,</hi> whereby ſome falſe thing is auouched or ſpread abroad concerning God, and his wil or works. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14. <hi>The Prophets prophecie lies in my name.

                     <hi>Vnto the celebration or magnifieng of God are repugnaunt</hi> 1. <hi>Contempt of God,</hi> &amp; the omitting of his praiſe. 2. <hi>Contumelie againſt god, or blaſphemy,</hi> which is to ſpeak of god ſuch things as are contrary to his nature, properties, and wil, either of ignoraunce, or through an hatred of the truth, and of God himſelfe. Now the Scripture diſtinguiſheth the blaſphemy againſt God, that is, whatſoeuer is ſpoken contumeliouſly or reprochfully againſt God, ether of ignorance, or againſt the conſcience, (As, 1. <hi>Timot.</hi> 1.13. <hi>When J before was a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemer, and a perſecuter, and an oppreſſer: but J was receiued to mercie: for I did it ignorauntly through vnbeliefe</hi>) from the bleſphemie againſt the holy Ghoſt, which is, againſt their conſcience to ſtriue againſt the known truth of god, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their minds are conuicted by the teſtimony of the holie Ghoſt: which ſinne who commit are puniſhed by God with a blindnes, ſo that they neuer repent, nor obtaine remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Euery ſinne and blaſphemy ſhal be forgiuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men: but the blaſphemie againſt the holie Ghoſt ſhal not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vnto men.</hi> Whence it appeareth, ſeeing Paul ſaith hee was a blaſphemer, and yet obtained pardon; and ſeing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chriſt affirmeth that ſome blaſphemy is forgiuen, and ſome is not forgiuen: that the name of blaſphemy is taken in diuers ſenſes.</p>

                     <hi>Vnto the confeſſion of the truth is repugnaunt</hi> firſt, <hi>The denial of the truth for feare of hatred, or perſequution, or ignominie.</hi> This deniall is of two ſortes: <hi>The firſt is, an vniuerſal and general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from true religion, which is to caſt awaie the profeſſion of the truth, either certainelie or doubtfullie knowen and receiued, with a certaine and purpoſed aduiſe, and with the whole hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reſiſting God, and without anie griefe or remorſe of flying and ſhunning this caſting awaie of the truth, and without any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of obeying God in applying vnto himſelfe the promiſe of grace and in ſhewing repentaunce. This denial is proper to reprobats and hypocrites.</hi> Whereof is ſpoken <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. and 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. And this defection, if it be don againſt the truth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen, is ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, whereof none repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other denial is ſpecial and particular,</hi> which is the deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of weaklings, &amp; is committed either through error not voluntary, neither purpoſed, or through feare of affliction, when as notwithſtanding there remaineth ſtill in the hart an inclination and griefe deteſting that weakneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and ſome purpoſe alſo to ſtruggle out of it, and to obey God, by applying vnto himſelfe the promiſe of grace, and by giuing himſelfe vnto repentaunce. Into this denial may the elect and regenerate fall, but they get out of it againe, and returne vnto the confeſſion of the truth in this life, as it is ſhewed and exemplied in Peter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. Secondlie, <hi>Vnto confeſſion is alſo oppoſed diſſimulation, or diſſembling and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the truth, when as Gods glorie and our neighbours ſafetie requireth a confeſſion of the truth: which then requireth it, when falſe opinions concerning God, and his wil, or woorde, or concerning the church, ſeeme to be confirmed and ſtrengthned by our ſilence in the mindes of men: or when thoſe thinges remaine ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which God wil haue known and manifeſt for the maintenance of his glorie againſt the reproches of the wicked, for the conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the obſtinate, and for the inſtructing of thoſe which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to learne:</hi> or laſtly, <hi>when our ſilence maketh vs ſuſpected to be approuers and abetters of the wicked.</hi> Thirdly <hi>vnto the right and lawfull confeſſion of truth, is oppoſed an vnſeaſonable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timelie confeſſion,</hi> that is, whereby without any aduancing of Gods glory, and without the furtherance of any ones ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without any neceſſity of diſcharging his calling or
<pb n="925" facs="tcp:19538:471"/>
duety, there is ſtirred vp either a deriſion and euill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the truth, or the fierceneſſe and cruelty of the enemies againſt the godly. Such a confeſſion, whereas it dooth rather darken than ſet forth the glory of God, &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindereth than furthereth the ſafety of the Church, ſwarueth plainly from the ſcope and end of true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confeſſion, and therefore is not a right vſing but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of Gods name. Therefore Chriſt forbiddeth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Giue not that which is holie to dogs.</hi> And Paul, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Reiect him that is an heretique, after once or twiſe admonition, knowing that he that is ſuch is peruerted, and ſinneth beeing damned of his own ſelf.</hi> Neither doth that croſſe this, which is ſaid, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Be readie alwaies to giue an anſwere to euerie man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekeneſſe and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> For Peter <hi>willeth vs to be alwaies in a readineſſe or furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to make aunſwere</hi> concerning the ſumme and groundes of Chriſtian doctrine: yet ſo, as that it is not neceſſary to vtter and expound all vnto euery one, but vnto all thoſe, which require a reaſon and an account of our faith, therby either to learne it, or to know it. But whom we ſee once to ſcoffe at the true doctrine which hath beene expounded &amp; confirmed vnto them, if they again require a reaſon and account of our faith, we are not to make further anſwere. For ſo Chriſt himſelfe after hee had ſufficiently confeſſed and confirmed his doctrine by teſtimonies, anſwereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto the High-Prieſt and Pilate touching the falſe witneſſes, and, <hi>Luk</hi> 22. himſelfe rendereth this reaſon of his ſilence: <hi>If J ſhal tel you, you wil not beleeue me.</hi> Another reaſon is giuen by Iſaiah cap. 53. <hi>He was oppreſſed and was afflicted, &amp; did not open his mouth,</hi> that is, becauſe Chriſt knewe he was now to ſuffer according to his fathers will, after his cauſe was ſufficiently defended, he is not careful of deliuering his perſon from iniuries, contumelies and puniſhments. For he knewe that this obedience did tend to his fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But contrariwiſe, when the High-Prieſt adiureth him, he confeſſeth himſelfe to bee Chriſt, becauſe then his ſilence woulde haue giuen ſuſpicion of contempt of the name of god, whereby he was adiured Obiection. <hi>We do not perceiue who are ſwine and dogs: wherefore we are to render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our faith to al without putting anie difference.</hi> Aunſwere.
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:19538:472"/>
Chriſt doth not cal al wicked men ſwine or dogs, but thoſe only, who contemne and make a mock of the doctrin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, which they haue heard and which hath beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto them. 2. Chriſt willeth not vs to iudge of dogs and ſwine by the ſecretes of their hearts, but by their preſent words and deedes.</p>
                  <p>If againe it be replied, <hi>In matters of difficultie, and ſuch as are hard to be iudged, except there be deliuered ſome certaine and exact rule how to iudge and deale, mens conſciences are left waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and in doubt.</hi> 1. <hi>But if alſo we are to iudge of the outward ſhew of ſwine and dogs, it is hard to pronounce, who are to bee accounted for ſwine and dogs; Therefore mens conſciences are left in doubt, vnto whom, and when confeſſion muſt bee made:</hi> The Minor is falſe. For Chriſt wil haue none to be counted for dogs and ſwine, but ſuch as ſhew manifeſt ſtubburnes and obſtinacy in their woords and deedes, of whom it is no hard thing to iudge out of the word of God. And further the holy Ghoſt is promiſed vnto all that aske him, by whom their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and actions may be directed, that they er not. And laſtly, ſeeing in this life we attaine not vnto the perfection of Gods Law, neither in other things, neither in this point; they who ioine the deſire of Gods direction with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt care of Gods glory, and loue of their neighbour, may and ought to be certain &amp; aſſured, either that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are ſo ruled by the holy Ghoſt, that they erre not, or, if they er, that yet their error is pardoned &amp; forgiuen them. And this certainty ſufficeth for the reteining of a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>If laſtly it be obiected, <hi>That tyrants and manie Magiſtrates which perſecute the church are ſwine and dogs, And therefore wee according to Chriſts commaundment are not to make aunſwere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them if they demaund our religion:</hi> wee aunſwere that this reaſon is a fallacy of the accident. For if the Magiſtrates demaund our religion, or any other by their commiſſion and in their name, we are neceſſarily to make aunſwere of our confeſſion vnto them, both in reſpect of their office, wherunto we owe obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; alſo in reſpect of gods glory; according as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhalbe aſhamed of me, and of my words among this adulterous and ſinfull generation, of him ſhal the Sonne of man be aſhamed alſo, when he
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:19538:472"/>
commeth in the glorie of his Father with the holie Angels.</hi> And Mat. 10. &amp; Luk. 12. <hi>When they ſhal bring you vnto the Synagogs, and vnto the rulers, and Princes, take no thought howe or what thing ye ſhal aunſwere, or what yee ſhall ſpeak. For the holie Ghoſt ſhal teach you in the ſame houre, what ye ought to ſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthlie, <hi>vnto lawfull confeſſion is oppoſed the abuſing of chriſtian liberty,</hi> or giuing of offence in things indifferent, which is, by the vſing of thinges indifferent, to confirme errours in the mindes of the aduerſaries, or in their minds that are weake, or to alienate them from true religion, or by our example to prouoke them to an imitation accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an euill conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Jf thy brother be grieued for the meat, now walkeſt thou not charitablie; deſtroie not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died.</hi> 21. Cor. 8.9. <hi>Take heede leaſt by anie meanes this power of yours be an occaſion of falling to them that are weake.</hi> And, <hi>Acts.</hi> 24.

                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>vnto true confeſſion are oppoſed all ſcandals and offences giuen in manners,</hi> when as namely they which profeſſe true religion, lead a lewde and wicked life. For thereby they giue occaſion vnto the aduerſaries &amp; thoſe that are weake, to iudge and ſpeake ill of that religion, whoſe followers they ſee to liue ill: and therefore this is reputed and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered among the chiefe contumelies and abuſes of Gods name. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. <hi>The name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles through you.</hi> Pſal. 50.16.

                     <hi>Vnto zeale for the glorie of God is oppoſed,</hi> 1 In the defect, <hi>Cowardneſſe, or litherneſſe in maintaining Gods glorie,</hi> which is, <hi>either not to be ſtroken with a griefe when god is reproched,</hi> and ſo neglect gods glory; <hi>or not to haue and ſhew in words and deeds a deſire to hinder, according to his place &amp; calling, the reproching of gods name, or to faigne and pretend zeale for gods glorie.</hi> They runne into this vice, who forbidde not raſhe oathes and blaſphemies, becauſe they are not led with a zeale for the glorie of God, whereby they ſhould be mooued to reproue and forbid (yet ſo, as it bee according to their degrees and

Now this is done when as <hi>either wee take that to bee the glorie of God, and endeuour to defend it, which is not the glorie of God, neither ought to be defended:</hi> or <hi>when we take that to be an impairing or defacing of gods glorie, and labor to repell it, which is no impairing of gods glorie, neither ought by anie meanes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled:</hi> and againe, <hi>when either gods glorie is otherwiſe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than it ought to be defended, or the impairing of gods glorie is preuented and repelled otherwiſe then it ought to be repelled.</hi>

Fourthly, <hi>Jdolatrous inuocation,</hi> which either is directed vnto falſe Gods, or creatures, or tieth Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of vs and his preſence to a certain place or thing, that is, without the commaundement or promiſe of God. For as in the firſt commandement God forbiddeth that honor which is due vnto him alone, to be tranſlated vnto others; and in the ſecond commaundement forbiddeth any other worſhip of his name and God-head to be vſed, beſides that which himſelfe ordained: So in this third commandement he forbiddeth the profeſſion of both (namely both of the worſhipping of any other beſides the true God, and of any other worſhip, beſides the true worſhip of God) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemneth al ſuch adoration and worſhip. For inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation aſcribeth vnto him, vnto whom it is made, infinite wiſedome, and power, as who in all places and at all times vnderſtandeth, and heareth euen the ſecret groanes of them that call and inuocate on his name, and is able to help and preſerue al, euen beſides and againſt the order of ſecond cauſes, and to giue them thoſe good things, which can be giuen onely of him who is the Almighty creatour, gouernor, &amp; Lord of al things. Wherefore idolatrous and

Firſt, they do amiſſe to take that properly, which Chriſt ſpake allegoricallie and by way of parable, in tranſlating his ſpeech from corporall thinges, vnto ſpiritual things, not thereby to ſhewe that theſe are like vnto them, but by applying his ſpeech as might beſt fit our capacity, to aduertiſe vs of the ſtate of the godlie and wicked after this life. For ſoules haue not either boſomes wherein to receiue one another, or eies to lift vp, or tonges to be dried with thirſt, or fingers to dip into water, neither doe they vſe any mutual parly or conference from hell and heauen.

And Stephen alſo being on earth ſaw Chriſt being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and Paul heard Chriſt ſpeaking from heauen; neither yet doe al the Saintes ſee or hear, what is done in heauen, neither did Stephen and Paul ſee or heare theſe things at al times.</p>

For the Antecedent propoſition hath no ſufficient enumeration of thoſe waies, whereby Chriſts honor is tranſlated vnto others. For not onely they which by their owne proper vertue and worthines, but alſo they which by Chriſts vertue merit of god thoſe bleſſings that are promiſed for the merit of Chriſt onely, are put in the place and office of Chriſt. For no man beſides Chriſt is able to merit of god any thing, not ſo much as for himſelfe,

of the creature which God forbiddeth to bee giuen vnto the creature, is not honourable but reprochful and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious vnto god. Now the reaſon is ſottiſh, whereas they wil ſeem to draw it from the words of Chriſt; when Chriſt ſpeaketh of the duties of charitie, which god willeth vs to perfourme in this life towardes thoſe, that ſtand in neede of our aide and help.</p>
                     <p n="20">20 <hi>Jf the Angels vnderſtanding our neceſſities praie for vs, and ſo are to be praied vnto, it is lawful alſo to praie vnto Saints: But that the Angels pray for vs, is confirmed by the woords of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie.</hi> 1.12. <hi>The Angel of the Lord aunſwered and ſaid, O Lorde of hoſtes, how long wilt thou be vnmerciful to Ieruſalem, and to the citties of Judah?</hi> Aunſwere.

Therefore they beeing alſo here on earth ſee and know our miſeries, which the Saints ſee not, vnto whom this charge is not committed; &amp; they pray par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for many, which we cannot affirme of the Saints by any teſtimonies of Scripture. 3. There is another fault in the conſequence, in concluding that wee muſt pray to them, becauſe they pray for vs: becauſe not euerie one who praieth for vs, is ſtraight waies to be inuocated, as was before declared. The ſame is to be anſwered of the dreame of Iudas Maccabeus, 2. <hi>Macab.</hi> 15. Wherein hee ſawe Onias the High-Prieſt, and Ieremias the Prophet praying for the people.

                  <hi>The parts of this fourth commaundement are in number two, A commaundement, and a reaſon of the commaundement.</hi> The parts of the commandement are alſo two: <hi>The firſt is Moral: That the ſabboth be ſanctified,</hi> that is, that ſome certaine time be alotted to the miniſtery of the Church, or to the publick ſeruice of God. <hi>The other part is Ceremoniall and Temporarie, namely, that that time be the ſeuenth day,</hi> &amp; that therin be kept the Leuitical ceremonies. That this part bee temporarie and the other perpetual, is vnderſtoode by the end of the commaundement, and by the cauſes of both parts, whereof more ſhal be ſpoken afterwardes. Now we wil in few words expound the wordes both of the commaundement, and of the reaſon adioined vnto the commandement. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once knowen, ſo much the eaſier ſhal bee vnderſtoode thoſe things which are afterwardes to bee ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſabboth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember thou keep holy the ſabboth daie,</hi> that is, with great care and religion keepe holy the ſabboth day. Not without cauſe doth God ſo ſeuerely commaund the keeping of the ſabboth, 1. <hi>Becauſe the breach and violating of the ſabboth, is the breach and violating of the whole worſhip of God.</hi> For the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the miniſtery doth eaſily corrupt the doctrine and worſhip of God. 2. <hi>Becauſe by the exacting of the ceremoniall or typical ſabboth, God would ſignifie the greatneſſe and neceſſitie of the ſpiritual ſabboth.</hi> 3. <hi>Becauſe god wil haue the external ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both to ſerue for the beginning and perfecting of the ſpiritual ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both in vs.</hi> 4. <hi>Becauſe he willeth the ſabboth to bee kept holy and to be ſanctified,</hi> that is, that ſinnes ſhould be eſchued and auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein, &amp; good works done, and that it ſhould not be
<pb n="942" facs="tcp:19538:480"/>
ſpent in ſlothful idleneſſe. <hi>Now god is otherwiſe ſaid to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſabboth, than are men: God is ſaide to ſanctifie the ſabboth,</hi> becauſe he appointeth it for diuine worſhip: men are ſaide to ſanctifie it, when they referre it to that vſe vnto which god hath appointed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou and thy ſonne, and thy daughter, &amp;c.</hi> He will haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our children and familie to ceaſe from their labours for two cauſes. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſtrainger &amp;c.</hi> Hee willeth alſo ſtraingers to intermit their labours, and that, if they were conuerted vnto true religion, becauſe they were of the houſhold of the Churche if they were infidels, he commandeth it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not in reſpect of themſelues, but in reſpect of the Iſraelites; 1. <hi>Leaſt by their example they ſhould giue offence vnto the Church.</hi> 2. <hi>Leaſt their libertie might bee an occaſion vnto the Jewes to accompliſhe by them thoſe labours, which it was not lawfull for them to woorke by them ſelues, and ſo the lawe of God ſhould bee deluded.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is aunſwere made vnto three queſtions, 1. <hi>Whether other nations were alſo bound to the Moſaical ceremonies, if any of them liued among the Iewes.</hi> 2. <hi>Whether they which are aliens from the church may or ought to be forced to religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 3. <hi>Whether the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, among which was alſo the Sabboth, ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnto Infidels with the Church.</hi> Vnto theſe queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we thus anſwer. <hi>As concerning binding &amp; conſtraint,</hi> the ſtrangers which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed among the Iewes, were not forced either to al cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or to religion, but to external diſcipline, which was neceſſary for the auoiding of breeding offences in the Church, wherein they liued. For a Magiſtrat ought to be a maintainer of diſcipline &amp; order, according to both tables of the Decalogue, amongeſt his ſubiectes, and to forbid manifeſt idolatry and blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, <hi>as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the binding there was a peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and reſpect of the ſabboth,</hi> which was not then firſt by Moſes preſcribed vnto the Iſraelits, but commanded by God from the beginning of the world vnto all men, and ſo
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:19538:480"/>
did bind all men vntill the comming of the Meſſias. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed this commaundement and ordinance was ſo growen out of vſe among other nations, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it among the number of the chiefe reproches, wherewith they derided, and ſcoffed at the Iewes. <hi>Furder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the ſabboth was no ſacrament vnto Jnfidels,</hi> becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the promiſes belong vnto them, that God would be their ſanctifier; neither were they therefore conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ceaſe from their daily labours, as for a teſtification or confeſſion of this promiſe, but onely for auoiding of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for preuenting of ſuch occaſion of breaking the ſabboth, as might bee giuen by them vnto gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Theſe thinges are alſo the better vnderſtood by this, that <hi>their cattle alſo are commaunded to reſt,</hi> whoſe reſt had no reſpect or conſideration either of Gods woorſhippe, or of a Sacrament, but was commaunded only in reſpect of men: 1 <hi>That all occaſion of labouring might be cut off by forbidding the labour, or vſe of their beaſts.</hi> 2 <hi>That alſo they ſparing brute beaſts, might learne how greatly God wil haue regard to be had of mercie and fauourableneſſe towards men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For in ſixe daies.</hi> This reaſon which is annexed vnto the commaundement is drawne from Gods reſt, &amp; appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the ceremonial commaundement concerning the Seuenth day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And reſted on the ſeuenth day.</hi> That is, hee ceaſed to create anie newe partes of the world, as being nowe perfect, and ſuch as god would haue it to be. This ſeuenth day he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to diuine ſeruice, 1. <hi>That by the example of his owne reſt, as a moſt forcible and effectuall argument hee might exhort men to the imitation thereof.</hi> And ſo the imitation of this reſt is double; <hi>Ceremoniall or ſignifieng; and Morall or ſpirituall,</hi> or ſignified. 2. <hi>That this reſt of the ſeuenth day might bee a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the creation then finiſhed and abſolued by God, and of his perpetuall preſeruation and gouerning of his worke euer ſince that day, vnto his owne glorie, and the ſafetie of his choſen:</hi> and that ſo it might be a pricke to ſtir vs vp to the conſideration &amp; magnifieng of Gods workes towardes mankind. Furder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>God did not therefore grant ſix daies vnto labour, and the ſeuenth to diuine woorſhip,</hi> that on other daies the worſhippe of God ſhoulde bee omitted; but hee requireth theſe two
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:19538:481"/>
thinges; 1 <hi>That on the ſabboth day, there bee not onely a priuate ſeruing of God, as on other daies, but alſo a publike ſeruing of him in the Church.</hi> 2 <hi>That on that day all other labours ſhould giue place both to the priuate and publicke ſeruice of God, which on other daies euerie one doth exerciſe according to his vocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are furder to beware of <hi>a Jewiſh ſuperſtition,</hi> which Chriſt alſo doth once &amp; again refute in the Goſpel, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>to thinke it vnlawfull to performe on the ſabboth day whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer woorkes belonging to the neceſſitie either of his owne life, or of anothers.</hi> For by the end of the commaundement it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that only ſeruile woorkes, or ſuch as hinder the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the miniſterie are forbidden of God, but not thoſe which hinder not the publicke ſeruice of God, but rather furder, foſter, and aduance the ſame. So, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth his Diſciples, pulling the eares of Corn on the ſabboth day, to driue awaie hunger; and himſelfe healeth a man hauing a dried hand.</hi> Luk. 14. Chriſt ſaith, that an Ox or any beaſt falling into a pit on the ſabboth may be drawen out thence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſin. Macchabaeus fighteth on the ſabboth day, that there might be ſome preſerued which ſhould keep the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. 2. <hi>Mac.</hi> 15. And of the like actions there are two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons giuen. 1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 2.40. <hi>Jf wee all doe, as our brethren haue done, and fight not againſt the Heathen for our liues, and for our Lawes, then ſhall they incontinently deſtroy vs out of the earth.</hi> Therefore they concluded at the ſame time ſaying; <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall come to make battle with vs vpon the Sabboth day, wee will fight againſt him.</hi> For the maintenance of their life and religion, they ſay it is lawfull to fight euen on the Sabboth day. By the ſame reaſons doth Chriſt defend his Diſciples and himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. citing a place of Hoſea, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>If yee knew what this is, J will haue mercie and not ſacrifice, yee would not haue condemned the innocent.</hi> And <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. <hi>The Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth;</hi> that is, ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all woorks muſt giue place to morall woorkes, ſo that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ceremonies muſt be omitted, than ſuch woorks of charity, as our neceſſitie or the neceſſity of our neighbour requireth. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Haue ye not read in the Law how tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on the ſabboth daies the Prieſts in the Temple break the Sabboth, &amp; are blameleſſe? But I ſaie vnto you, here is one greater than the Temple.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Ye on the Sabboth daie circumciſe a man.
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:19538:481"/>
If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the Sabboth receiue circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Law of Moſes ſhould not be ye broken; be angrie with me, becauſe J haue made a man euerie whit whole on the Sabboth daie?</hi> By which words hee ſheweth that ſuch workes as hinder not the vſe of the Sabboth, but rather further &amp; eſtabliſh it, (ſuch as are the workes which appertaine ſo to the ſeruice of god or ſacred ceremonies, or to charity and loue towards our neighbor, as that preſent necesſitie will not ſuffer them to bee differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill another time) do not breake or violate the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, but are moſt of all required to the right and lawfull obſeruation and keeping of the Sabboth.</p>
               <p>Now we are furder here to obſerue that there is a three-fold difference of forbidding works and ſinnes. 1. <hi>Labors are forbidden but in a reſpect only,</hi> to wit, as they hinder the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Church, or as they giue offence to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>But ſinnes are ſimply forbidden.</hi> 2. <hi>Labours are forbidden on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be vſed on the ſabboth daie, ſinnes are forbidden at al times.</hi> 3. <hi>The ceaſing from labors is a type of ceaſing from ſinnes,</hi> which is the thing ſignified by that type.</p>
               <p>What things are remaining to bee knowen concerning the ſabboth, wee will now conſequently goe forward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. And becauſe one part of this commandement is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, we ſhall not vnfitly afterwards adioine the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ceremonies.</hi> Laſtly we wil annex in brief wiſe vnto theſe the common place <hi>concerning the miniſtery of the church,</hi> becauſe by this commaundment is the external publique ſeruice of god enacted; and therefore alſo the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery it ſelfe of the church, and the vſe &amp; honor thereof.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, <hi>the ſabboth is of two ſorts: Internal, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The Jnternal, or Moral or ſpiritual, is the ſtudie of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his works, of auoiding ſinnes and of worſhipping God by confeſſion and obedience.</hi> To be ſhort; <hi>The ſpiritual ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, or ſpiritual reſt is a ceaſing from ſinnes, and an exerciſing of the workes of God.</hi> This ſabboth, although it bee continuall &amp; perpetual with the godly, yet is it begun in them in this life, and <hi>is called the ſabboth,</hi> both becauſe this is that true reſt from labours &amp; miſeries, and the conſecration of vs to gods worſhip, and alſo becauſe it was in times paſt ſignified by the ceremonial ſabboth. And this ſpritual Sabboth ſhall be perfectly &amp; perpetuallie continued in the life to come, wherein is a perpetual worſhipping &amp; magnifieng of God, al thoſe labours being left and ſurceaſed, wherein wee are now buſied and occupied. <hi>The external or ceremonial ſabboth is a certaine time ordained and inſtituted by god in the church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to a ceaſing from workes and labours, and giuen to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of gods word, &amp; to the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, or to the external publick worſhip of god.</hi> This ceremonial ſabboth was neceſſary, in the old Teſtament, to be the ſeuenth day, &amp; that on that day (as alſo on other holy daies) the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ceremonies ſhould be obſerued.

                  <p>THE works which are to be done on the ſabboth daie, or the partes of the ſanctifieng of the ſabboth day are comprehended in the word <hi>Sanctifieng,</hi> which parts we will briefly expound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The partes then of the ſanctifieng of the ſabboth</hi> are, 1. <hi>Rightly and truly to teach and inſtruct the church concerning god, and his wil.</hi> The teaching which is here commanded is of another kinde from that, which was mentioned in the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. For there it belongeth to euery priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to teach: heere the function of teaching is enioined as proper vnto certaine perſons, and that vnto ſuch perſons as beeing furniſhed from aboue with neceſſary giftes are lawfully called by the church vnto this function; and vnto them is it enioined in this commandement, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and deliuer found doctrin to al men, both in publick aſſemblies, and in priuate inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Rightlie to adminiſter the ſacraments according to Gods diuine inſtitution.</hi> This likewiſe muſt bee perfourmed by the miniſters of the Church lawfullie called to diſcharge this function. And as the doctrine, ſo alſo this adminiſtration of the ſacraments is not tied to certaine daies, but it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth if the adminiſtration be publique, and be done by the
<pb n="949" facs="tcp:19538:483"/>
miniſters, (who beare a publique perſon, and repreſent in the miniſtery the perſon of god himſelf talking with men) and if alſo in the aſſemblies of the Church thoſe thinges be done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which god hath tied &amp; annexed vnto the miniſters. So <hi>circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion</hi> was adminiſtred on any day, which fel out to be the eighth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Infants natiuity. So <hi>Baptiſm</hi> alſo may be adminiſtred at anie time, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. &amp; 10. <hi>But the adminiſtration of the ſacraments ought chieflie to be exerciſed on the Sabboth daie.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Num.</hi> 28. &amp; 29. beſides daylie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices there are certain ſacrifices appointed, which were to be perfourmed on the Sabboth &amp; on feſtiual daies. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermore this adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be in publike aſſemblies. For ſo Chriſt alſo inſtituted his ſupper (as which amongſt other ends, muſt be alſo a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of church aſſemblies) to be adminiſtred in the aſſembly of the church, bee it great or be it ſmall. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Drinke ye all of this.</hi> Vnto the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration alſo of the ſacraments belongeth the excluding and debarring of thoſe, whom God hath commaunded to be excluded from them. Like as it was not lawful for thoſe that were aliens from the Country and religion of the Iewes, neither for any of the vncircumciſed to eate of the Paſchal Lamb, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. So neither ought the church to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnto the Lords ſupper thoſe that are not baptiſed, or thoſe that are baptiſed, but yet are aliens in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and manners from Chriſtianity. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.</p>

Theſe things are made manifeſt by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and neceſſary dependancie of Correlatiues. For if god will haue ſome to be teachers, hee will alſo haue ſome to be hearers and learners of this Doctrine. And the ſtudy of learning is not without priuate Meditation. Therefore haue the men of Beraea their commendation, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Thus they receiued the word with all readineſſe, and ſearched the Scriptures dailie, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> But vnto them eſpecially is the ſtudy of knowing the Doctrine of god en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned,

                  <p n="4">4 <hi>To vſe the ſacraments according to gods Jnſtitution.</hi> So god commaunded the Paſſeouer to be celebrated in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne aſſemblie of the people, and vnto other holy daies and ſabbothes he aſſigned certaine ſacrifices. And in like manner god will that, as his Doctrine ſhould bee heard, ſo alſo the right and lawfull vſe of his ſacraments ſhould bee ſeene and behold in the publicke meetings and aſſemblies of the Church: becauſe god will haue both theſe to bee markes whereby his Church may be knowen &amp; diſcerned from other ſects and peoples. Againe, as the woord, ſo alſo the ſacraments are an inſtrument or exerciſe to ſtirre and maintaine in vs faith and godlineſſe. They are alſo a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke profesſion of our faith and thankefulneſſe towardes God, and a part of Gods publicke worſhip in the Church. Therfore the vſe of them is moſt agreeable and fit for the Sabboth day.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Publicke Jnuocation of God, whereby we ioine our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thankes-giuing, praiers, &amp; deſires with the Church.</hi> For god will be inuocated not only priuately by euery one, but alſo publickely by the whole Church, for his owne glory, &amp; our comfort, that ſo we may the leſſe doubt that God will hear vs, ſeeing he hath promiſed to heare, not onely vs, but alſo others, and the whole Church praying for vs together with vs. For therefore hath God annexed a ſpeciall promiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publicke prayers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19. <hi>If two of you ſhall agree on earth vpon anie thing, whatſoeuer they ſhal deſire, it ſhal be giuen them of my Father which is in Heauen. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them. And giuing of thankes, and praiſe vnto God,</hi> is promiſed vnto God as a ſpeciall woorſhip, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Jn the middſt of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation will I praiſe thee:</hi> And the ſame is commanded, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>When thou bleſſeſt with the ſpirite, how ſhal he that occupieth the roome of the vnlearned, ſay Amen, at thy giuing of thankes, ſeeing he knoweth not what thou ſaieſt?</hi> And, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>I exhort, that firſt of al ſupplications, praiers, interceſsions, and giuing of
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:19538:484"/>
thankes be made for all men.</hi> Now whereas Chriſt elſe where commandeth that <hi>when a man praieth,</hi>

                     <hi>he enter into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp; when he hath ſhut his doore, pray vnto his Father which is in ſecret:</hi> he by theſe words doth not condemne and forbid publicke praiers, but hypocriſie and oſtentation, and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned godlineſſe: which the woordes teſtifie that goe before. <hi>When thou praieſt, be not as the Hypocrits.</hi> Now hypocriſie is a faigning and an oſtentation or ſhew of Godlineſſe. We are here furder to obſerue, that in this commandement is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the publicke inuocation of the Church, but that which was in the former commaundement preſcribed, is the priuate inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which concerneth euery particular man.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>To beſtowe almes,</hi> that is, to performe the duties of loue and charity, thereby to ſanctifie the Sabboth, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our obedience, which wee yeelde vnto the Doctrine. <hi>Hither appertaineth the ſermon of Chriſt concerning the ſabboth, wherein he declareth againſt the Iewes whether it be lawfull to doe good on the ſabboth daie.</hi> And whereas God will haue this Sabboth to be kept all our life time, yet will he haue exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and teſtimonies thereof to bee ſhewed eſpecially on the externall or ceremoniall Sabboth day, that is, at thoſe times which are allotted to the teaching and learning of Gods worde. For if neither at that time any man ſhewe his deſire of obaying God, when Gods Doctrine ſoundeth in his eares, and when God willeth vs, ſurceaſing &amp; omitting all other cares, to meditate on Godlineſſe &amp; amendment of life; he giueth a token that he will farre leſſe doe it at an other time. Therefore hath it beene alwaies the cuſtome in the Church, to beſtowe almes on the Sabboth day, and to performe the workes of charity towardes thoſe that are in want. <hi>Nehem</hi> 8.10. <hi>Send part vnto them, for whom none is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for this daie is holie vnto our Lord.</hi>

Nowe that obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the miniſtery comprehendeth many things, Firſt, <hi>reuerence,</hi> that is, an acknowledging of Gods order and will in the ordeining and maintaining of the Miniſtery, and in the gathering of his Church by it: that is, a declaration
<pb n="952" facs="tcp:19538:485"/>
both in woords and deeds of this our acknowledgement &amp; iudgement of the Miniſtery. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Let a man ſo thinke of vs, as of the Miniſters of chriſt, and diſpoſers of the ſecrets of God,</hi> Secondly, <hi>loue,</hi> whereby wee gladly both frequent diuine aſſemblies, and heare &amp; learn the Doctrine of the church, and wiſh well vnto the faithfull Miniſters of the Church, not onely in reſpect of that duty of charity which we owe, but alſo in reſpect of the miniſterie, which they diſcharge. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles?

For to hold and celebrate that ſpiritual Sabboth, is, in the direction and ordering of our life to obey the voice of God, ſpeaking by the miniſterie of the Church. For God will therefore haue the true doctrine to be learned of vs, that we may obey it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. <hi>Bee yee doers of the woord, and not hearers onelie, deceiuing your owne ſelues.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Thankefulneſſe,</hi> that is, ſuch duties as tend to the preſeruation and mainteinance of the miniſtery, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Schooles. For if God will haue miniſters to be in his church, he will alſo that euery one according to his ability helpe forwarde and furder the maintenance of the Miniſterie, &amp; Schooles of learning, &amp; doe his endeuor that the miniſters, teachers, &amp; ſchool-maſters be honeſtlie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for. Hither appertain Moſes Lawes of the firſt-born, of firſt-fruits, of tithes, &amp; ſuch like offerings, which were alotted to the Prieſts &amp; Leuites by way of ſtipend, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might ſuſtaine their owne life &amp; their houſhould, that ſo they might wholly bee employed in the miniſterie. And albeit the circumſtances of theſe lawes are aboliſhed, yet the generall remaineth for euer; becauſe God wil haue his miniſterie to bee maintained to the end of the world. Fiftly &amp; laſtly, <hi>Lenitie and moderation in bearing with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the miniſters,</hi> as doe not enormouſly or manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt or hinder the miniſtery, &amp; hurt the church by offence. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Againſt an Elder receiue none accuſation, but vnder two or three witneſſes.</hi> Seeing then this is the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieng &amp; keeping holy of the Sabboth, it followeth that

The Maior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true concerning the morall lawe, the notions whereof were imprinted in mans minde at the firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but it is not true, as touching the ceremonie or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the ſeuenth day, as which after the fall was made a type of the benefites of the Meſſias in the Moſaicall lawe, &amp; therfore in like maner as other ceremonies which were either then, or before inſtituted, it became ſubiect to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation &amp; change by the comming of the Meſſias. For god would not haue the ſhadowes of thinges to continue or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, the thinges themſelues being once come and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.

                     <p n="6">6 <hi>The cauſe of a law beeing perpetual doth make the lawe it ſelfe alſo perpetual.

He ſaith that the ſecond commaundement is like vnto the firſt or great commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or, the ſecond table is like vnto the firſt table, which is thus to be vnderſtoode. 1. <hi>As touching the kind of the chiefe worſhip of God,</hi> the ſecond table is like vnto the firſt; and ſo is the ſecond ſaid to be like vnto the firſt, in reſpect of the ceremonial, which are not the chiefe worſhip. 2. <hi>As touching the kinds of eternal puniſhment,</hi> becauſe the tranſgreſſion of both tables meriteth eternal puniſhment. 3. <hi>As touching the vnſeparable coherence of the loue of God and our neighbour.</hi> For our neighbor cannot be loued without the loue of God: &amp; the loue of God is declared &amp; exerciſed by the loue of our neighbour. Whence alſo wee may gather the cauſes, <hi>for which obedience is to bee yeelded vnto the ſecond table,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1. <hi>That in this obedience God himſelfe may be worſhipped, and our loue towardes him ſhewed and declared, by our loue towardes our neighbour for his ſake.</hi> 2. <hi>That by the loue of our neighbor our conformitie with God maie appeare.</hi> 3. <hi>That the ſocietie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind maie be preſerued, which was ordained of God for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and magnifieng of his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer this fift commandement is placed firſt in the ſecond table, 1. <hi>Becauſe this is the cauſe, the bond, and ground of the obedience of the reſt of the commaundements following.</hi> For if this obedience ſtand which is of the inferiours towardes the ſuperiours, who are thoſe which commaund the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the commaundementes that follow, then muſt the obedience towards the reſt of the commaundements ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:19538:490"/>
follow. 2. <hi>Becauſe the Lord annexed a ſpecial promiſe, and a ſingular bleſſing vnto this commandement, to wit, length of life;</hi> and theſe two, namely the commaundement and the promiſe, doth this fift commaundement conteine. <hi>Now the ende of the commaundement is, the preſeruation of ciuill order,</hi> which is the order decreed and appointed by God in the mutual duties of ſuperiours and inferiours. <hi>The ſuperiours</hi> are al ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom God hath ſet ouer others to rule and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. <hi>The inferiours</hi> are thoſe, whom he hath ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the power of others to bee ruled and defended by them The duties of ſuperiours are comprehended by the name of Father and Mother.</p>
               <p>Now Parents rather than other gouernors are named, and commanded to be honoured, 1. <hi>Becauſe the father-like power and gouernement was the firſt among men.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe this is as it were a rule, according to which others are to bee compoſed and framed.</hi> 3. <hi>Becauſe it is moſt beloued of men.</hi> 4. <hi>Becauſe ſeeing the bond of duetie towards Parents is the greateſt, the contempt of them is the more heinous and grieuous, which therefore alſo is with greater ſeueritie condemned by god.</hi> 5. <hi>Becauſe god will haue ſuperiours to beare a father-like mind and affection towards their inferiors.</hi> By the name therefore of Parents are vnderſtood all ſuperiors, or whoſoeuer rule ouer vs. <hi>For theſe doth God giue vs in ſteede of Parents, and they diſcharge the duetie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, &amp; are as it were gods vicegerents in ruling and gouerning vs:</hi> and then firſt were Magiſtrates ſubſtituted by God for Parents vnto vs. when the malice of men beganne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>Our ſuperiours are, 1. <hi>Parentes themſelues.</hi> 2. <hi>Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Teachers, Miniſters.</hi> 3. <hi>Maſters or Lordes.</hi> 4. <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> 5. <hi>Our Elders.</hi> Vnto all theſe are preſcribed in this fift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement <hi>their dueties towardes their inferiours, and thoſe that are vnder them:</hi> and firſt, <hi>the common dueties to all,</hi> then, <hi>ſuch as are peculiar and proper vnto ſome.</hi> For when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the dueties of inferiours towards ſuperiours, he doth alſo of the contrary commaund the dueties of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours towardes inferiours. And when he commandeth vs to honour our Parents, he will withall that both they bee as Parents vnto vs, and alſo behaue themſelues as worthy of honour. Nowe amongeſt theſe degrees of the dueties
<pb n="964" facs="tcp:19538:491"/>
of ſuperiours, the firſt is the chiefe and principall of al the reſt; 1 Becauſe the reſt ſerue for that, and helpe to further it. 2 Becauſe this was the firſt in mankind. Obiection. <hi>God in this commandement willeth onlie our parents to be worſhipped, which is the dutie of inferiours. Therefore hee commaundeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here vnto ſuperiours.</hi> Anſwere. I deny the conſequence of this reaſon. 1 <hi>Becauſe, when hee giueth the names vnto the ſuperiours, he giueth them alſo the thing it ſelfe, or that from whence they haue the name.</hi> 2 <hi>If God will haue them to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he will alſo haue them to doe thoſe things that are woorthie of honour.</hi> And albeit ſometimes wicked men beare rule, and therefore are vnworthie of honour; yet the office is to bee diſtinguiſhed from the perſons, and whoſe vice wee ought to deteſt, their office wee muſt honour, becauſe it is Gods ordinaunce. Seeing then the ſuperiours are to bee honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in reſpect of their office, it is manifeſt that ſo far forth onely we muſt yeelde obedience vnto them, as they paſſe not the bondes of their office. God annexeth <hi>a promiſe</hi> to this commandement. Firſt, <hi>To ſignifie howe greatlie he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that obedience, &amp; how grieuouſly he wil puniſh thoſe which do againſt this obedience.</hi> Secondly, <hi>To ſignifie how neceſſary this obedience is, and ſo much the more to inuite vs to the obſeruing and keeping thereof.</hi> For this obedience towardes parents, is a preparing and a motiue cauſe to the whole obedience of the Lawes which followe. S. Paul alleaging this promiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2. ſaith, <hi>That this fift commaundement, is the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement with promiſe,</hi> that is, with ſpeciall promiſe, or of a certaine particular bleſſing, which God promiſeth to them that perform obedience. And the bleſſing or benefit which he promiſeth, is long life. Obiect. <hi>But long life ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to bee any bleſſing or benefite by reaſon of the miſeries of this life.</hi> Anſwere. This commeth but by an accident: for long-life is a bleſſing by it ſelfe, though it bee ioined with miſerie. Reply. <hi>That blesſing by reaſon of theſe accidents ſeemeth rather worthie to bee wiſhed awaie from vs, than to be wiſhed to come vnto vs.</hi> Aunſwere. A good thing is to be wiſhed away from vs, if it haue accompanieng it greater euils. But god promiſeth vnto the godly together with long life a mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of calamities, and a long fruition of Gods bleſſing. Moreouer the worſhip and celebrating of God in this life
<pb n="965" facs="tcp:19538:491"/>
is ſo great a good, that the calamities of this life ought not to enter the ballance with it. If furder it bee demaunded; <hi>Why then are the wicked alſo and diſobedient long-liued.</hi> One anſwere hereto, is, That a general rule is not ouerthrowen by the varying of a few examples. For the diſobedient, for the moſt part, periſh after an euill manner and vntimelie. <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 30.17. <hi>The eie that mocketh his Father, let the rauens of the vallie picke it out.</hi> Another aunſwere is, That corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall benefits are beſtowed on the Godly for their ſafetie &amp; ſaluation, and therefore are tokens and arguments vnto them of Gods good will towades them: but on the wicked ſuch are beſtowed, partly that they being thereby called &amp; inuited to repentaunce may become more excuſeleſſe in gods iudgement; partly, that the godly and elect, which are mingled among the wicked, may enioy theſe bleſſings. And againe, that all godly and obedient children, are not long-liued; that croſſeth not this promiſe, becauſe vnto them their tranſlating into a better life, is a moſt ample &amp; large recompence of long life.</p>

                     <hi>Jndignation</hi> or zeale is a vertue iuſtly offended, &amp; wrath for the reproch of Gods name, the vniuſt hurting of our neighbor, &amp; for ſome grieuous iniury, which is done either againſt God, or our innocent neighbor, hauing moreouer a deſire, as ability and ſtrength affordeth, to repel and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the iniury done againſt God or our neighbours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods commaundement. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. <hi>Gideon ſaid to Zebah, &amp; Zalmunna: The men that ye ſlue at Tabor, were my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, euen my Mothers children: as the Lord liueth, if ye had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their liues, I would not ſlaie you.</hi> And Iud. cap. 20.

For either it is, as before was ſaid, a neceſſary defence againſt thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe robbery, and violence, or cruelty againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or a iuſt puniſhment for grieuous iniuries, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by ordinary autority with force of arms. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.28. <hi>My Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord.</hi> Hither alſo belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the defence of their owne life and their neighbours,

which priuate men vſe againſt vniuſt force and violence when neceſſity ſuffereth not the Magiſtrates aide to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.

               <p>Whereas all ſorts of luſts are repugnant vnto chaſtitie, and to the drift and ſcope of this commaundement, the ſame are to bee noted and obſerued. They may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto three ſeuerall kindes: <hi>Of the firſt kinde are thoſe which are contrarie to nature,</hi> and from the Diuel, namely, ſuch as are euen againſt this our corrupt nature, not onely becauſe they corrupt it, and bereaue it of that conformity with God, but alſo becauſe this our corrupt nature abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them: of this kind are thoſe, which are recited by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. as confounding of kindes and ſexes, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the vnnatural abuſage of woman-kind. Theſe heinous ſinnes and horrible treſpaſſes are to bee puniſhed by the magiſtrate with extraordinarie puniſhments. Inceſt hath for a great part, a repugnancie with this our nature, albeit there were examples of inceſts in our firſt pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, becauſe thoſe were doone but of neceſſitie, and by diſpenſation from God himſelfe. Therefore this was an exception from the generall rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the ſecond kinde are thoſe which proceed from this our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature,</hi> as fornications amongſt thoſe that are free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marriage, adulteries betweene perſons that are both mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, companings of married perſons with others that are vnmarried. If a married perſon haue companie with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married perſon, it is <hi>a double adulterie;</hi> for he violateth both his owne wedlocke, and the others. If a married man haue to doe with an vnmarried woman, it is <hi>ſimple adultery. Simple fornication</hi> is of thoſe that are vnmarried. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
<pb facs="tcp:19538:501"/>
are by duty bound ſeuerely to puniſh inceſtes &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries. For they are much more heinous than thefts &amp; robberies. God appointeth death for adulteries. Nowe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God did not ordaine that ſimple-fornication alſo ſhould be puniſhed with death, yet when he ſaith after, <hi>Let there not be a whore among you,</hi> hee ſignifieth that it is to bee puniſhed in his kinde. There are other things alſo, which are committed of this our corrupt nature with an euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as luſtes and euill deſires, vnto which we yeeld, or wherewith wee are delighted, neither endeuour to auoide them. Such vitious and lewd deſires, and the like, although they bee not puniſhed in the ciuill court, yet are they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an euill conſcience, and are puniſhed of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the third kind are corrupt inclinations,</hi> vnto which yet good men doe not yeeld, but with-ſtand them, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them all occaſions, and their conſcience is not troubled, becauſe God is inuocated and called vpon, and the grace of reſiſtance is deſired, and there is remaining in their hearts a teſtimonie of the remiſſion of their ſinnes. And for a remedie for theſe ſinnes, after the fall was mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age appointed. Therefore againſt theſe inclinations is it to be ſaid, <hi>It is better to marrie, than to burne.</hi> But yet S.

<pb facs="tcp:19538:503"/>
                     <hi>Thoſe things are paſſed from the Owner againſt his wil,</hi> which are either by right of warre, or by captiuity taken away from an enimie. <hi>Thoſe thinges are paſſed awaie with the owners liking,</hi> which are paſſed vnto another either by enheritance, or by contract &amp; bargain. <hi>By inheritance</hi> things are paſſed ouer to another, either by Teſtament, or without any Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>A contract</hi> or bargaine is a conſent and agreement betweene any of paſſing ouer any things, or of the communicating or exchanging of them, according to iuſt &amp; honeſt Lawes. Al contractes are comprehended vnder commutatiue iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Now there are <hi>tenne ſortes of contractes.</hi> 1. <hi>Bying and ſelling;</hi> when a thing is paſſed from the buier vnto the ſeller, ſo that the buier pay the ſeller a iuſt equiualent price for it. This is ſometimes either with a condition of ſelling it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or with a condition of not ſelling it againe, ſo that the buier cannot ſell that, which hee bought, vnto others. Vnto buying belongeth the buying of reuennues; for that is no vſury; as neither is the ſetting out of ground to farme at a certainey rate yearelie to bee paed. 2. <hi>Loane,</hi> which is a contract, wherin the vſe of a thing is paſſed to another, ſo that there bee repaired as much againe. In loane a thing is giuen, not that the ſame thing ſhoulde bee reſtored, but the like, or that which is of the ſame value. 3.

paſſed to another, as being bound to be his for vſe, till ſuch time as other thinges which are owed him, are repaied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: or when a thing is deliuered a man for a certaine time, that if in the meane ſeaſon it be not redeemed, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maie haue the right of vſing it at his pleaſure. 8. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting on truſt, when a thing is deliuered to another to keepe, ſo that neither the vſe, nor the poſſeſſion, but only the keeping &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie of the thing is committed vnto him.</hi> 9. <hi>Partnerſhip,</hi> which is a certaine contract vſed by them who trafique together, wherein one emploieth his mony, the other his woorke, or labour with this condition, that part of the gain may come to each of them. 10. <hi>A certaine contract,</hi> wherein the vſe of a ground, or the poſſeſſion of a ground to vſe is paſſed by the owner vnto an husbandman, with a certaine condition, as namely, that hee til and labour the ground deliuered vnto him, and be bound vnto the Maſter to performe certaine dutie, or ſome certaine ſeruice.

                     <hi>The extremes or vices contrarie to commutatiue iuſtice are theſe,</hi> 1. <hi>Vnto commutatiue iuſtice are repugnaunt all vnlawfull conueiaunces of things, which are done either by violence, as rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries; or by guile and deceite, as thefts. Theft</hi> is the taking away of that which belongeth vnto another beſides the owners knowledge, and wil, with mind and purpoſe to depriue him thereof. <hi>The ſpecial ſorts of theft</hi> are, <hi>Robbery of a common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie: Counterfeiting of merchandize,</hi> when one vſeth ſleights and guiles in contractes: <hi>Sacrilege, couſinages,</hi> and al corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of contractes, among which vſury hath not the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place. <hi>Vſurie</hi> is that which is taken aboue the principall in regarde of the loane onely. <hi>From vſurie are exempted</hi> iuſt contracts, Partnerſhip, Buying, contractes of paying rents, iuſt recompence of any dammage or loſſe. There are many Queſtions of vſury concerning which wee maie iudge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying; <hi>Doe as thou wilt be done vnto, and what thou wilt not haue done vnto thee, that doe not thou vnto another.</hi>

He that vndergoeth not thoſe labours, which he is able &amp; ought to vndergoe, committeth theft. Obiection. <hi>There is mention made of fidelitie in the fift commaundement; Therefore it hath no place here.</hi> Anſwere. It is no abſurd thing, that one and the ſame vertue ſhould be placed in diuerſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements for diuerſe ends &amp; reſpectes. For the ends of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make the actions differ. <hi>Fidelitie is placed in this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,</hi> as it is a diligence and endeuour employed in the with-ſtanding of others diſcommodities, and in doing ſuch works and labousr, whereby we may get vs food, raiment, and things neceſſarie. <hi>Fidelitie is placed in the fift commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as it is an obedience ſhewed in doing our dutie. <hi>The extremes</hi> hereof are, <hi>Vnfaithfulnes,</hi> not reſpecting or heeding any harmes and dammages, neither diligently performing the dueties of his calling and vocation, Likewiſe, <hi>Rechleſnes and Slothfulnes,</hi> which onely taketh part and fruition of publique commodities, but it ſelfe conferreth nothing to the common ſocietie of men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Liberalitie,</hi> which is a vertue giuing to them that want, according to the rule of vpright reaſon: that is, which imparteth vnto others his owne goods, not by any due bond or obligation, but according to the lawe of God and nature, or for godlineſſe &amp; charitie ſake, with a liberal hart, according to his owne ability, &amp; the neceſſity of others; as well knowing where, when, to whom, &amp; howe much hee may giue, &amp; obſeruing a mediocritie &amp; meane betweene
<pb facs="tcp:19538:504"/>
baſe niggardlineſſe and riotous prodigality. <hi>The Extremes</hi> hereof in the defect are, <hi>Illiberalitie, Couetouſneſse, Baſeneſſe. Couetouſneſſe</hi> is a deſire of encreaſing our ſubſtance by right &amp; wrong, &amp; a reſtraint of iuſt &amp; lawfull giuing. In the Exceſſe, <hi>Ouerlaſhing, Prodigalitie,</hi> which giueth beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and without need, with a reioycing in ſuch exceſſiue largis. Of this vice it is ſaid, <hi>Sicke art thou who takeſt delight in lauiſhing.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Hoſpitalitie,</hi> which is one kind of liberalitie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie liberalitie and bountfulneſſe towardes trauailers and ſtrangers, eſpecially towardes thoſe that are exiles for the profeſſion of the goſpell, entertaining them with all duties of hoſpitalitie, and Chriſtian charitie. <hi>The Extremes</hi> are, <hi>Inhoſpitalitie, and prodigality towardes ſtrangers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Parſimonie,</hi> which is a vertue eſchewing &amp; ſhunning riot, &amp; all vnneceſſary expences or giftes, keeping thoſe things which are his owne &amp; well gotten, &amp; profitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them to his owne vſe and theirs, that belong vnto him, neither ſpending more, than he ſeeth to be needefull. <hi>This vertue is referred to this commandment;</hi> becauſe, if in this commandment Liberalitie be commanded, the contrarie thereof then is alſo here forbidden, namely Ouerlaſhing, whereunto is oppoſed Sparingneſſe &amp; Parſimonie. <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hath Parſimonie accompanying it;</hi> &amp; they both are two meanes betweene the ſame extremes; that is between Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes &amp; Prodigality; becauſe Liberality without Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonie degenerateth into Prodigalitie; &amp; Parſimonie without Liberalitie degenerateth into Couetouſneſſe &amp; Baſeneſſe. And therefore hee is not liberall, who is not ſparing; neither is he ſparing, who is not liberall; <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> enlargeth our giuing according to ruled reaſon. <hi>Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> reſtraineth the ſame according to ruled reaſon, &amp; ſpareth ſo much, as is requiſite for neceſſary vſes. So then theſe two vertues are exerciſed in the ſame matter, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſame extremes, &amp; therefore the ſame vices which are contrary to Liberality, are repugnaunt alſo to Parſimony.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19538:505"/>
charges vpon ſuch things euer as are neceſſary, &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>This vertue is of neere affinity with parſimony. Frugalitie or thriftineſſe</hi> conſiſteth and dependeth on ruled reaſon. <hi>The extremes</hi> are the ſame both of frugality, &amp; of parſimony, to wit, <hi>Prodigality and couetouſnes,</hi> or niggardlineſſe.</p>

The name of <hi>Truth</hi> here is taken for truenes or truth-ſpeaking, that is, for the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or correſpondence of our knowledge or ſpeech with the thing, whereof our ſpeech is. <hi>True</hi> we terme the ſpeech it ſelfe agreeing with the thing.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The vertues of this ninth commaundement, together with their vices.</head>
                  <p>THE chiefe &amp; principal vertue, which is here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is <hi>truth.</hi> 1. <hi>Truth</hi> or truenes, is a vertue, whereby we loue true opinions &amp; ſpeeches, and ſeeke after them, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, and gladly profeſſe and defend them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as both our duty, and perſons, places, times, and other circumſtances require, vnto the glory of God, &amp; the ſafety of our neighbor. This end maketh that the Diuel ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaid to be true, although he ſomtimes ſpeak that which is
<pb n="994" facs="tcp:19538:506"/>
true. For his is true, who ſpeaketh and loueth the truth, &amp; doth affection it for the glory of God, and the ſafety of his neighbour. <hi>Truth</hi> may alſo be defined on this wiſe: <hi>Truth</hi> is a firme election in the wil, whereby we conſtantly embrace true ſentences &amp; opinions, ſpeak that which is true, keepe couenants &amp; promiſes, &amp; auoide al deceitful diſſemblings both in ſpeech and outward geſture. <hi>True confeſſion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded both in this, and in the third commaundement:</hi> as often times the ſame vertu is required to the obedience of diuers commandements. <hi>But in the third commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t true confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is required,</hi> as it is the honour and worſhip of God, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſpecting God: <hi>and here it is commanded,</hi> as there is a will in vs not to deceiue our neighbour, but to wiſhe his ſafety &amp; welfare. Vnder the name of <hi>truth</hi> we compriſe <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of ſpeech,</hi> which is a vertu wherby, as much as the time, place, &amp; neceſſity requireth, we profeſſe the truth freely, &amp; boldly, &amp; are not withdrawne through the fear of dangers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnto truth, in the defect, are repugnant,</hi> 1. <hi>Al lies,</hi> vnto which appertain al guiles, diſſemblings, negligence in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the truth of thinges, lies of courteſy; likewiſe ſlanders, backbitings, euil ſpeakinges, which kindes of lying are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunt alſo vnto Fairneſſe of maners &amp; conditions. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is, to ſpeak otherwiſe, or to ſignify otherwiſe by outward geſtures, than thou thinkeſt, &amp; than the thing it ſelfe is. So then in this commaundement principally is lying forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. <hi>Vnto lying is referred alſo wilful ignoraunce,</hi> which is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mind. <hi>Officious lyes, or lyes of courteſie are to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> becauſe euil is not to be doone, that good may come of it. And al lying that doth expreſſely diſſemble the truth, is condemned. But a <hi>truth</hi> which is vttered by a figure, is no ly whether he vnderſtand it or no, with whom we deale. This is to be obſerued that we bee not too rigorous in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Saints; &amp; alſo, that we excuſe not thoſe things which haue no neede to be excuſed. 1. Obiect. <hi>That which profiteth another, and hurteth no man, is not ſinne. A dutiful lie is of ſuch qualitie. Therefore it is no ſinne.</hi> Anſwere. The Minor is falſe. Reply. <hi>But yet the truth is often not to bee ſpoken.</hi> Anſwere. We muſt not put a difference between the hiding of the truth and lying. Obiect. <hi>God bleſſeth the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues, becauſe thy told a lie. Therefore God alloweth and liketh of
<pb facs="tcp:19538:506"/>
lies.</hi> Aunſwere. God therefore bleſſeth the mid-wiues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feared God, &amp; ſlue not the infantes of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites. 2. <hi>Vnto truth, in the defect, is repugnaunt vanitie or leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> which is a readines to lieng. He is <hi>vain,</hi> who lieth much, often, &amp; eaſilie, and that without anie ſhame. <hi>A lier is he, who hath a deſire to lie. Vnto truth, in the exceſſe, is repugnant,</hi> 1. <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely profeſſing of the truth, which is to caſt pearles to ſwine, and to giue that which is holy vnto dogges,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, who by theſe words doth wholy forbid vnneceſſarie and vntimely profeſſing of the truth. For, as the verſe hath it in the Poet, <hi>He that warneth out of time, doth harme.</hi> 2. <hi>Curioſitie,</hi> which is to ſearch after thinges vnneceſſary, or vnpoſſible. Theſe things may ſuffice for this chiefe and principall vertue of this ninth commandement. The vertues which folow, wait vpon trueth, and they all are as it were of truthes retinue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Faireneſſe of minde</hi> is a vertu, which taketh wel things well or doubtfully ſpoken or done, and interpreteth them in the better part, to wit, as farre as there are any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſes to induce thereto, &amp; doth not eaſily conceiue ſuſpicions, neither ſticketh vpon ſuſpicions, though they be ſuch as are iuſt, &amp; haue reaſonable cauſes: hee doth not ground thereon, neither directeth his actions according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither decreeth or determineth ought by them. It is defined after this manner, <hi>Faierneſſe of minde</hi> is a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto truth, allowing of others wils vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon, &amp; hating all euil-mindedneſſe, &amp; drawing alſo ſome things that are doubtfull to the better part; &amp; hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in deede that which is good, but yet as touching mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thinges thinking that the wils of men may change, and that a man may erre concerning anothers will, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infoldings and ſecret places of mans mind are not beheld. <hi>The Extremes</hi> of this vertue, in the defect, are, <hi>Slaundering and Suſpiciouſneſſe. Slaundering,</hi> is, not onelie falſly to criminate &amp; attach the innocent, but alſo to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete things indifferently ſpoken in the worſer part, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to interlace &amp; coine ſome falſhoode. <hi>Suſpiciouſnes,</hi> is, to take things well or ambiguouſly ſpoken in the worſer part, to ſuſpect euill thinges of thoſe that are good, or to ſuſpect without cauſe; or alſo to make to much of tru ſuſpicions. It is lawful for vs ſomtimes to ſuſpect, except we wil be fools.

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16.17. <hi>Beware of men: be ye wiſe as ſerpentes, &amp; innocent as doues. In the exceſſe, fooliſh Credulitie, &amp; fooliſh flatterie. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie,</hi> is, haſtily or vnaduiſedly to interprete any thing, or to aſſent to one without iuſt &amp; probable cauſe: Or, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a thing of another, when there are manifeſt or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſons to the contrary. <hi>Flatterie or aſſentation,</hi> is, to praiſe or like things not to be praiſed, thereby to get either the goods or fauour of another man. <hi>Faireneſſe of mind,</hi> is, an aſſiſtant or ſpecial kind of truth. Therfore it is alſo here together with trueth commanded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Simplicitie,</hi> which is open trueth without wrinkles or fetches and compaſſings: or, it is a vertue which doth properly and plainly ſpeake and doe ſuch thinges as are true, right and declared in artes &amp; common life. Trueth is tempered with ſimplicity &amp; faireneſſe of mind or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>The extremes of ſimplicitie are, Fained ſimplicitie, and Doubleneſſe in manners and conuerſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Conſtancie,</hi> which is a vertue not departing from the knowen trueth, neither altering his purpoſe without good and neceſſary cauſes, but conſtantly ſpeaking &amp; dooing ſuch thinges as are true, iuſt, &amp; neceſſarie. Or, it is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue perſiſting in the trueth once found, knowen, &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; in the like maner profeſſing &amp; defending the ſame. Conſtancy is neceſſarie for the preſeruation &amp; mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the trueth. Therefore it is here alſo commanded. <hi>The extremes hereof in the defect, are Vnconſtancie, or Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> which is to alter true purpoſes &amp; opinions without reaſon. <hi>In the exceſſe the extremes are, Pertinacie or ſtoicall ſtifneſſe and rigour,</hi> which is a vice ariſing from a confidence in his owne wit, or from pride &amp; oſtentation, refuſing to yeeld or depart from his opinion, albeit it bee ſuch as hee ſeeth by ſtrong reaſons to be falſe, but perſiſting in falſe opinions, or vniuſt &amp; vnprofitable actions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Docilitie,</hi> or a readineſſe to learne, which is a vertue ſearching after the reaſons of true opinions, eaſily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, &amp; yeelding to thoſe that teach or ſhew better things, &amp; that vpon certaine reaſon, &amp; framing his will ready to aſſent vnto true or probable reaſons, &amp; to leaue thoſe thinges which before he held &amp; embraced. The ſame are the <hi>extremes</hi> of Docilitie, which are of conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, wherunto
<pb n="997" facs="tcp:19538:507"/>
alſo this Docilitie is neceſſarie. For <hi>Conſtancie without Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie degenerateth into Pertinacie; and Docilitie without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie degenerateth into Leuitie.</hi> Now al theſe vertues which haue beene numbered agree and are linked verie well one with another. For <hi>Trueth muſt bee tempered with Faireneſſe of minde and Simplicitie, perceiued and knowen by Docilitie, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and maintained by Conſtancie.</hi> And ſo theſe former ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are required to the being of truth. Now the three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues following are required to the profitable beeing of the trueth in the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Taciturnitie or ſilentneſſe,</hi> which is a vertue withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſilence thinges ſecret &amp; vnneceſſarie to bee ſpoken, where, when, &amp; as far as is needful; &amp; auoiding ouer-much babling &amp; talkatiuenes.

Pratling,</hi> is, not to be able to keepe cloſe any thing. <hi>Fooliſh Prating,</hi> or futilitie &amp; follie of ſpeech, is to ſpeake vnſeaſonably, immoderatelie, &amp; fooliſhly. In the exceſſe, <hi>Haughtineſſe, Peeuiſhneſſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of the trueth,</hi> where are neceſſarie, or probable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Peeuiſhneſſe,</hi> or <hi>moroſitie,</hi> is an ouer-much ſilentneſſe &amp; burying of the truth, where gods glorie &amp; the ſafety of our neighbour, or our owne or others cauſe, or the loue of our friendes requireth vs to ſpeake. <hi>Silentneſſe without affability becommeth Moroſitie or peeuiſhneſſe, and Affabilitie without Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentneſſe becommeth pratling, and fooliſh prating, babling out thinges hurtfull, vnneceſſarie, vaine, or ſecret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>Affability or readines of ſpeaking,</hi> which is a vertu gladly, &amp; with ſignification of good wil hearing, anſwering, ſpeaking where need is vpon a neceſſarie &amp; probable cauſe; or it is a vertue eaſilie entertaining the mutual talkes of others, &amp; giuing ſignification of the good wil in conferences, ſpeech, &amp; geſtures. Or, <hi>Gentlenes, facility, affabilitie,</hi> conſiſt in giuing care &amp; making anſwere vnto others, with ſome ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good wil.

<pb facs="tcp:19538:508"/>
knowen will, and to performe vnto our neighbour for gods ſake al duties required, &amp; to regard &amp; maintaine his ſafety &amp; welfare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vnto orinall iuſtice, originall ſinne, or concupiſcence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunt,</hi> which is an inordinate appetite, or a corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination &amp; proneneſſe, in the minde, will, &amp; heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to God, and deſiring thoſe thinges, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth in his Law; which enſued vpon the fall of our firſt parents, and was from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deriued to all their poſteritie, ſo deprauing and corrupting their whole nature, that all by reaſon of this corruption are become obnoxious to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting wrath of God, neither are able to doe ought that is pleaſing to God, except pardon be graunted for the ſonne of God, the Mediator, and our nature be renued by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of originall iuſtice towardes our neighbour there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes:</hi> 1. In the defect, <hi>Original ſinne</hi> towardes our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which is a deſire and wiſhing of thoſe thinges, which hurt our neighbour. 2. In the exceſſe, <hi>Jnordinate loue of our neighbour,</hi> when for his ſake we neglect God. We are heere to obſerue, <hi>that not onelie corrupt inclinations are ſinnes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the thinking of euil is ſinne,</hi> to wit, as the thinking of euill ioined with a deſire of doing it. Now <hi>that concupiſcence is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil and ſinne, albeit it be borne with vs,</hi> there is no doubt. For, we are not to iudge according to nature, but according to the lawe, whether a thing bee ſinne or no, be it or be it not borne with vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Pelagians denied concupiſcence to be ſin.</hi> But Paul ſaith the contrarie, <hi>Roman.</hi> 7.7. <hi>J had not knowen concupiſcence (or luſt) except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> Their obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Obiect. <hi>Natural things are not ſins. Concupiſcence is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural thing. Therefore it is no ſin.</hi> Anſ. There is a fallacy of the accident in the Minor. For concupiſcence was not before the fal, but enſued after the fal. Againe, this word <hi>Naturall,</hi> hath a diuers conſtruction. For in the Maior it ſignifieth a good thing created of God in nature, to wit, mans appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite before the fall, which was not contrarie to the Lawe. In the Minor it ſignifieth a thing, which wee haue not of nature, but which we purchaſed vnto vs after the fall. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie.
<pb facs="tcp:19538:509"/>
                  <hi>An affection or appetite, euen in nature now corrupted, to deſire good things, and eſchue hurtfull things is not ſin. But ſuch is concupiſcence. Therefore it is no ſinne.</hi> Aunſwere. An Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation whether it bee according to Gods lawe, or inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which is mooued towardes ſuch thinges as diſpleaſe God, is ſinne. To deſire the fruit of a tree, is naturall: but as it was deſired of Eue, beeing forbidden of God, it was ſinne. <hi>But originall ſinne and concupiſcence differ.</hi> For concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is a propenſion to thoſe things which are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the lawe. <hi>Originall ſinne</hi> is the guilt of all mankind, the want of the knowledge and will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Obiection. <hi>That which is not in our power to cauſe either to bee in vs, or not to be in vs, is no ſinne. Concupiſcence is not in our power. Therefore it is no ſinne.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is true; except wee haue loſt that power through our owne fault: otherwiſe it is falſe. For God requiring of vs vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, doth not iniurie vs, becauſe hee commaunded them, when they were poſſible. Neither hath he nowe loſt his right of requiring that of vs which hee left with vs.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Obiection. <hi>In Baptiſme ſinne is taken away. Therefore concupiſcence is not ſinne in thoſe that are baptized.</hi> Aunſwere. The guilt of ſinne is taken awaie in baptiſme, but not the corruption or inclination to ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Obiection. <hi>Sinne maketh men obnoxious to the wrath of God. Concupiſcence doth not make the regenerate obnoxious to Gods wrath. Therefore concupiſcence is no ſinne.</hi> Aunſwere. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence dooth not make the regenerate obnoxious to the wrath of God, that is, by reaſon of the grace of God: but this commeth not thereof, as if concupiſcence were no ſinne. For neither doe other ſinnes condemne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. And this is it that the School-men ſay: <hi>The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of ſinne is taken away, and the Material remaineth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Obiect. <hi>Where the formall of ſinne is taken away, there alſo the thing it ſelfe is taken awaie, that is, the material of ſinne, or ſinne it ſelfe: But in baptiſme the formal of ſinne is taken awaie. Therefore ſin it ſelfe is taken away in Baptiſme.</hi> Anſwere. There is a double formal of ſinne. 1. <hi>The guilt,</hi> that is, the appointing of it to puniſhment, which guilt is taken awaie. 2. <hi>The repugnancie with the Law, and an inclination to ſin,</hi> which abideth.</p>

Vnto the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate who haue nature reſtored againe, the Lawe is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 1. <hi>As concerning outward order and diſcipline.</hi> 2. <hi>By the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of iuſtification and regeneration,</hi> both which benefites wee obtaine by faith. 3. <hi>As touching the beginning of inwarde and outward obedience in this life,</hi> 1. Ioh. 5.3. Likewiſe <hi>as concerning the imputation of Chriſtes iuſtice,</hi> in whom is our victorie. Hee that without the beginning of obedience, that is, without regeneration, glorieth that hee knoweth and worſhippeth God, is a lier. <hi>But the Law is vnpoſſible to the regenerate, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, that is, as touching the perfect inward and outwarde obedience of the Law.</hi> For they fulfil not the Lawe perfectly, becauſe they doe many things contrary to the Lawe. <hi>And thoſe things alſo, which they doe according to the Law, are vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> For in the regenerate are many ſinnes yet remaining, <hi>as original ſinne, many actual ſinnes, ignoraunces, omiſſions, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:</hi> which their ſins the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and bewaile.

                     <hi>PRaier is a petition ioyned with an ardent and earneſt deſire, whether vttered in woords or not vttered; whereby wee aske of the true god reueiled in the word thoſe things which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be asked of him; proceeding from an acknowledgement of our neceſſity and neede, with humilitie, and repentaunce, and confeſſion of our owne vnworthineſſe; made in true conuerſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God &amp; in a confidence and ſure truſt in gods promiſes, for chriſts ſake our Mediatour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint Paul maketh mention of three ſortes of praier. 1. <hi>Petitions</hi> for good thinges. 2. <hi>Deprecations</hi> againſt euill things. 3. <hi>Jnterceſſions and requeſtes</hi> for others. The General of theſe ſpecials is <hi>Praier;</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Jnuocation, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But praier differeth notwithſtanding from Inuocation &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration.</hi> For <hi>Adoration</hi> is often times taken for the whole worſhip of god; becauſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we woorſhip, him we account for the true God. <hi>But praier is a part of Inuocation: for Jnuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion compriſeth theſe two, as a general his ſpecials,</hi> namely <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or praier, and thankes-giuing.</hi> For <hi>Inuocation,</hi> or, to Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate on God is to craue of the true God any thing that is neceſſary, both for the ſoule and body, and to giue thanks
<pb facs="tcp:19538:511"/>
for benefits receiued of him. <hi>Thankefulnes,</hi> or Thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is an acknowledgement of a benefit receiued, and a voluntary binding to the performaunce of duties mutuall, poſſible, and lawful. <hi>Thankefulnes conteineth two things, to wit, truth, and iuſtice.</hi>

                     <hi>2</hi> Why Praier is neceſſarie.</head>
                  <p>THE cauſes, for which praier is neceſſary, are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The commandement of God;</hi> becauſe God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that wee call vpon him, and will this way chiefely and principally be worſhiped and magnified by vs. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.16. <hi>Call vpon me in the daie of trouble.</hi> Luk. 11.2. <hi>When ye praie, ſay, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> By theſe wordes of Chriſt it furder ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that the tongue alſo is required to praier: which we may proue alſo by other reaſons. 1 <hi>God wil haue himſelfe magnified with the tongue which hee created chieflie to this end.</hi> 2. <hi>Out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> 3 <hi>Wee are to doe it, that others may follow our example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Our Neceſſitie and Want:</hi> For wee receiue not of God thoſe bleſſings which are neceſſarie for our ſafety and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, except we aske them of him. For God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them to ſuch only as aske them. Nowe, what wee ſpeake of the neceſſitie of praier, the ſame is alſo to bee ſaide of the neceſſitie of Thankeſgiuing. For without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thanks we leeſe thoſe thinges that are giuen, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not ſuch thinges as are to be giuen and are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The necesſitie of both will eaſily appeare, whether we conſider the effects of faith, or the cauſe of faith, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo faith it ſelfe. Faith is kindled or encreaſed in no man, who doth not aske it: no man hath faith, who giueth not thankes for it: and they which are endued with true faith, aske the grace of God: and they who haue taſted of gods grace, ſhew themſelues thankfull vnto God for it, and doe more and more craue and deſire it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The loue of God is ſhed abroade in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, which is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</hi> And the holy ghoſt himſelfe alſo is obtained by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or praiers. For the holie Ghoſt is giuen to none but to him that deſireth him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Obiection. <hi>But we ſee the wicked alſo to receiue the gifts of the holie Ghoſt. Therefore not onlie they that deſire him receiue him.</hi> Aunſwere. The wicked verily receiue manie
<pb facs="tcp:19538:511"/>
gifts, but not thoſe principall giftes, neither thoſe that are proper to the Elect, ſuch as are faith, repentance, remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, regeneration; and furder what giftes the wicked receiue, thoſe are not auaileable vnto them, neither doe they receiue them to ſaluation. Reply. <hi>Jnfants craue not the holie ghoſt; and yet they receiue him.</hi> Aunſwere. The holy ghoſt is not giuen but to thoſe that aske him, that is, to thoſe of yeares and vnderſtanding, who are able to aske him. But euen Infants alſo aske and craue the holy ghoſt after their manner, hauing, to wit, in poſſibilitie an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to faith: and therefore potentially they aske the holy Ghoſt, or haue an inclination to aske him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Obiection. <hi>The Effect is not before his cauſe. But praiers are the effects of the holie Ghoſt, in aſmuch as no man can aske the Holie Ghoſt, who hath not the holie Ghoſt, and hee alone woorketh praier in vs: Therefore the Holie Ghoſt is not receiued by praier, but is in vs before praier; and ſo by conſequent he is not giuen to them onlie that aske him.</hi> 1 Aunſwere. Whoſoeuer hath not the holie ghoſt, cannot aske him, that is, as concerning the encreaſe of him. 2 The Effect is not before his cauſe, that is, in order and nature; but in time they are both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the holy Ghoſt is in vs according to nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe we then firſt begin to deſire him, &amp; to aske him of God, when he is giuen vnto vs. But albeit the Holie Ghoſt is according to nature or order firſt in vs, yet he is not firſt in vs according to time. For as ſoone as the holy Ghoſt is giuen, we begin to deſire his preſence. When God giueth his ſpirit, at the ſame time they aske him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome hee is giuen. And the Holie Ghoſt is giuen to none, but to him that deſireth him: for no man deſireth him, but he who hath in himſelfe the beginning of him. Whereas then it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>How much more ſhall your Heauenlie Father giue the holie Ghoſt to them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him;</hi> this muſt not be vnderſtood of the encreaſe onely, but alſo of the beginning of his giftes and graces,</p>

                  <p>THE conditions and circumſtaunces of true praier are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>A direction of it vnto the true God,</hi> that wee make our praier vnto the true God manifeſted in the Church by his Prophetical and Apoſtolique word, by his workes of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:19538:512"/>
preſeruation, and redemption of the Church. As wee haue receiued, ſo are we baptized; and as we are baptized, ſo we beleeue; and as we beleeue, ſo wee adore and worſhip the father, the ſonne and the holy ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The knowledge of Gods commaundement.</hi> For without Gods commaundement we doubt of being heard Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when wee pray, wee ought thus to reſolue: I call vpon thee, becauſe thou haſt commaunded me. When we know that it is the commaundement of God, that we ſhould pray vnto him, then we know alſo that our praiers are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God, which he requireth of vs in his word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>The knowledge of thoſe thinges which are to be asked.</hi> God will not onely haue our affection and deuotion to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto him, but he will alſo that we conſider, and know ſuch thinges as wee are to aske of him: otherwiſe it is not praying, but mocking of God; and therefore hath Chriſt preſcribed a forme of praier, out of which wee may learne what thinges wee are to aske of god. <hi>We are to aske</hi> (that I may ſummarily compriſe them) <hi>thinges both certaine, and allowed and permitted by God.</hi> Theſe are of two ſorts, <hi>Spiritual and corporal.</hi> God will haue vs aske both of him; and thoſe ſpiritual things, which are neceſſarie to ſaluation, we muſt aske without condition; but corporall thinges, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Obiect. <hi>Hee that asketh doubtfullie, asketh not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to faith: Wee aske corporal bleſſinges doubtfullie: therefore not according to faith.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or falſe. For the nature of faith requireth, that we be certaine, not of all corporal benefites, but onely of ſuch ſpiritual bleſſings as are neceſſary to ſaluation, as of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, and of life euerlaſting. Moreouer, albeit wee aske corporall bleſſinges with a condition; yet doe we not ſimplie doubt of obtaining them. For we beleeue that wee ſhall receiue thoſe corporall bleſſinges which wee aske of god, ſo that they bee expedient for vs vnto ſaluation, and after this ſort are they alwaies to be deſired conditionally. For they differ very much from thoſe benefites which are neceſſary to ſaluation, <hi>and likewiſe are to be deſired after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner. Such giftes as are neceſsarie to ſaluation, are ſimplie to be deſired,</hi> with a truſt and full perſwaſion of being heard; euen that wee ſhall receiue them as wee deſire, that is, in
<pb facs="tcp:19538:512"/>
ſpeciall. <hi>But gifts, which are not neceſſarie to ſaluation, whether they be corporall, or elſe ſuch ſpirituall, as without which we maie be ſaued;</hi> theſe are to be deſired verily, but with a condition of gods will and pleaſure, that he will giue them vs, if they ſerue for his glorie, and be profitable for vs; or that he will giue vs, other of better qualitie, either at this, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. We muſt follow in asking theſe benefits the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which ſaide, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 8.2.</note> 
                     <hi>thou canſt make mee cleane</hi> For neither doe the Elect, when they aske ſuch things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſimplie to be heard. For oftentimes we aske things not knowing what and what manner of thinges they be, and ſo neither know we whether the obtaining of them in ſpecial will profit vs, or bee pernicious and hurtfull vnto vs. God notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding will haue vs to aske of him corporal things and others that are not neceſſarie to ſaluation, 1. <hi>That the deſire of corporal thinges maie be an exerciſe of our faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our truſt and confidence of obtaining thinges ſpirituall, and auaileable to ſaluation.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe no man can looke for good and ſauing thinges at gods handes, except hee haue God reconciled vnto him. 2. <hi>That we maie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and profeſſe his prouidence,</hi> that neither thoſe vnneceſſary and corporall thinges befall vs by chaunce or fortune.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>A tru deſire of thoſe things which are to be asked.</hi> God wil not haue our petition to bee hypocritical or faigned, nor bredde in our mouth, but in our heart: hee will haue vs to pray with a true affection and deſire of the hart. Therefore an ardent deſire is to be made the general of all praier. So the Lord ſaid to Moſes, <hi>Why doſt thou cry vnto me?</hi> when yet Moſes ſpake nothing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>A ſenſe and feeling of our owne want.</hi> The acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and feeling of our owne want is the fountaine from whence our deſire ariſeth. For what thou thinkeſt not thy ſelfe greatly to want, that dooſt thou not earneſtly deſire: <hi>Pray:</hi> for al ſtand in neede of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Humiliation, that is, true repentaunce.</hi> We muſt needes haue alſo true humility, true acknowledgement of our owne vnworthineſſe, or true repentaunce and conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo proſtrate our ſelues in ſuppliaunt maner before his diuine Maieſty; 1. <hi>Becauſe God oweth vs nothing.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe we are his enemies before our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion. God doth not hear ſinners,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19538:513"/>
that is, proud ſinners, ſuch as was that Phariſee. And <hi>how greatly true humiliation, repentaunce, or conuerſion is required to praier,</hi> euen that dooth ſufficiently ſhew, <hi>in that the promiſes of God belong only to ſuch as are conuerted.</hi> Wherefore without conuerſion no man can pray according to faith: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith no man can be aſſured that he ſhal be heard.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>A confidence or ful perſuaſion of being heard, for the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators ſake:</hi> That we may reſolue that both our perſon &amp; our praiers pleaſe God for the Mediatours ſake, and that they are heard of him for chriſts merit. We muſt pray in chriſts name with a true faith, our praiers are to be put on our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar Chriſt: ſo ſhal wee be aſſured to bee heard. For if with a true faith we beleeue that Chriſt is that only altar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our praiers being offered aſcend into the ſight of God, wee muſt alſo with full confidence reſolue, that wee are thorough Chriſts merite iuſt before God; and that god is reconciled vnto vs by Chriſt: and that through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt our praiers are heard of god. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are Sonnes, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your harts, which cryeth Abba, father.</hi> But heere in this full perſuaſion of being hard we are to obſerue that difference of ſuch thinges as are to bee deſired, which was not long ſince declared.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>A confidence and truſt in Gods promiſe,</hi> that wee knowe and think that god hath promiſed to hear as many as ſhal cal vpon him, with thoſe conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before alleaged. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this promiſe of hearing there is no faith, without faith praier is but vain, and the promiſe is required for faith. But faith, or this confidence is required to praier; becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we giue faith and credit to gods promiſes, and thinke of them while we are praying, they auaile vs nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can wee deſire ought with a good conſcience: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when after this ſort we know not what we aske, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of gods hearing of our petition, wee doe not praie but mocke god. Now the confidence which wee haue of gods promiſe in hearing vs, breedeth in vs a certainty of his hearing and our ſaluation: and this certainty kindleth in vs a ſtudy of inuocation and of making ſupplications vnto god. By theſe conditions and circumſtances of ſincere and true praier eaſily doth it appeare, <hi>how much the praying of the
<pb facs="tcp:19538:513"/>
godly and the wicked differ. The godlie</hi> endeuour to obſerue al theſe conditions in their praying: <hi>the wicked</hi> contrarily either omitte and neglect them all, or keeping one or two conditions, erre in the reſt. <hi>Some er in the knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and wil of God,</hi> therein omitting the firſt condition: <hi>ſome erre in the thinges which are to bee asked,</hi> when they aske ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euill thinges, or vncertaine, or not approoued by god. <hi>Some aske theſe hypocriticallie:</hi> ſome <hi>without a feeling of their want:</hi> ſome <hi>not with a confidence in the Mediatour:</hi> ſome <hi>perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in their wickednes, thinke yet that God heareth them:</hi> ſome <hi>deſire things neceſſarie to ſaluation, with a diſtruſt and diffidence:</hi> ſome laſtly <hi>aske, not thinking of Gods promiſe, and therefore not according to faith.</hi>

                     <hi>4</hi> What is the forme of praier by Chriſt preſcribed.</head>
                  <p>THE forme of prayer preſcribed by Chriſt vnto vs is recited by the two Euangeliſts, Matthewe, and Luke. Which forme Chriſt deliuered vnto vs, not that we ſhould be tied to theſe woords; but that we might know both how and what to aske. Obiection. <hi>We may not be wiſer than Chriſt. Therefore ſeeing hee hath appointed vs a certaine forme of praier, we muſt hold vs contented therewith: and therefore we doe amiſſe when wee vſe other formes of praiers.</hi> Aunſwere. Wee maie not depart from that forme, if Chriſt will haue vs tied vnto it: but he will not haue vs tied to theſe words, <hi>becauſe his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was,</hi> when he taught his diſciples to pray, to deliuer a briefe ſumme of thoſe things, which we are to ask of God. Replie. <hi>That is to be reteined, than which no better can be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Wee cannot inuent a better forme, and better woords, than are theſe of Chriſt himſelfe. Therefore wee muſt retaine alſo the forme and woords.</hi> Aunſwere. Wee can not inuent better woordes, neither a better forme, that is, to expreſſe this ſumme of ſuch thinges as are to bee deſired, which is as it were the general of al thinges that are to be deſired. Theſe generals of gods benefits, which Chriſt in this forme hath preſcribed vnto vs to be deſired, cannot bee propoſed in a better forme: but Chriſt will haue vs alſo to deſcend to the ſpecials, &amp; to aske particular benefits according to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie. For that forme preſcribed by Chriſt is nothing elſe but a ſet or courſe of certaine heads, or generals, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al benefites as wel corporal as ſpiritual may be referred.
<pb facs="tcp:19538:514"/>
And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chriſt willeth vs to deſire the generals, he willeth vs alſo to deſire the ſpecials. And furder alſo thoſe things which are here put in general, we are in like maner for this cauſe, to declare in ſpecial; that we may be lead into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our neceſſity, &amp; to a deſire of making our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition vnto God, to help our neceſſity. Now that we may do this, we haue neede alſo of ſpecial formes of praieng. For to the explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of generals by their ſpecials we haue need of another form. But yet al other forms of praier muſt agree with this form preſcribed by chriſt; although we be not tied vnto this form of Chriſt, as being a thing altogether indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as appeareth by theſe places of Scripture: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Whatſoeuer ye aske of the father in my name</hi> (whether ye aske it in general or in ſpecial) <hi>he wil giue you.</hi> Wherefore Chriſt hath not tied vs to a certaine forme. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jf any of you lack wiſedome, let him aske, and it ſhal bee giuen him.</hi> Likewiſe, Matt. 20.24. <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the winter.</hi> But this as touching the woordes is not in the praier preſcribed by Chriſt. There are alſo examples of praiers both in the New and old Teſtament. Wherefore the forme of praier deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs by Chriſt, is wholy a thing indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Nowe this praier of chriſt hath three partes, <hi>a Proeme, a Petition, and a Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proeme is, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme hath two partes, 1. <hi>Our Father.</hi> 2. <hi>which art in heauen.</hi> And the Lord vſed this kind of Proeme, becauſe he wil be called vpon with due honor. This honor conſiſteth, 1. <hi>In true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> 2. <hi>Jn true confidence.</hi> 3. <hi>Jn obedience.</hi> Obedience compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, 1 <hi>True loue.</hi> 2. <hi>True fear.</hi> 3. <hi>Hope.</hi> 4. <hi>Humiliation.</hi> 5. <hi>Patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the Proeme, <hi>Our Father.</hi> God is called <hi>Our Father,</hi> 1. <hi>Jn reſpect of our creation.</hi> Luk. 3.38. <hi>The ſonne of Adam, the ſonne of God.</hi> 2. <hi>In reſpect of our redemption, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing into fauour by his ſonne our Mediatour.</hi> Chriſt is the only begotten ſonne of god; we are not his ſons by our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but are adopted for chriſts ſake. 3. <hi>In reſpect of our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or regeneration by the holie Ghoſt in Chriſt</hi> Obiect. 1. <hi>We Jnuocate the Father according to the preſcript of his own ſon: Therefore we muſt not inuocate the ſon and the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The conſequence of this reaſon is denied; becauſe the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce holdeth not from the attributing of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb facs="tcp:19538:514"/>
vnto one perſon of the god-head to the remouing of the ſame from another perſon of the god-head. Again, the name <hi>of Father</hi> (as alſo the name of god) <hi>when it is oppoſed to all the creatures, is taken eſſentially, not perſonally: but when it is put with another perſon of the God-heade, it is taken perſonallie.</hi> Wherefore in this place the name <hi>of Father</hi> is taken eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, &amp; the reaſons hereof are manifeſt: 1. <hi>Becauſe the name of Father is not here put with another perſon of the God-head, but with the creature, of whom he is inuocated.</hi> So alſo by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah, cap. 9.6. Chriſt is called <hi>The euerlaſting father.</hi> 2. <hi>The Jnuocating of one perſon, doth not exclude the others, when mention is made of their external &amp; outward works.</hi> 3. <hi>We cannot conſider God the father but in the ſonne, the Mediatour.</hi> And the Son hath made vs Sons by the holy ghoſt, who is called the ſpirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 4. <hi>Chriſt teacheth vs that we muſt inuocate him alſo,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Verilie, verilie, I ſay to you, whatſoeuer yee ſhal aske of the father in my name, he ſhal giue you.</hi> 5. <hi>Chriſt giueth the holie Ghoſt:</hi> Therefore it is hee himſelfe of whom wee aske him. Obiect. 2. <hi>Chriſt is called, and is our brother: Therefore he is not our father.</hi> Aunſwere. He is our brother, in reſpect of his humane nature: But hee is our father in reſpect of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature. Ob. 3. <hi>If he be called the father, who hath receiued vs into fauor for Chriſts ſake, then is not Chriſt vnderſtoode by the name of father,</hi> becauſe he that receiueth <hi>vs into fauour for chriſts ſake, is not Chriſt himſelf. But the father, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we here ſo cal, receiueth vs into fauor for chriſts ſake: Wherefore he is not chriſt.</hi> Anſw. Hee that receiueth vs into fauour for Chriſts ſake, is not Chriſt himſelfe, that is, not in the ſame ſenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Chriſt as he is our Mediatour, is hee through whom we are receiued; but as he is god, he is he that receiueth vs.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt wil haue vs to call <hi>God, Father,</hi> and ſo to inuocate him, 1. <hi>In regard of the true inuocation of God, who is the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 2. <hi>In regard of the tru knowledge of him,</hi> that we may know him to be our father, who through and for his Son the Mediatour hath adopted vs to be his Sons, when otherwiſe we were his enemies; <hi>I goe vnto my father, and to your father:</hi> and further alſo for his Sons ſake he rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerateth vs by the holy Ghoſt, and endoweth vs with all giftes and graces neceſſary. 3. <hi>In regard of reuerence,</hi> namely that in vs may bee ſtirred vp and raiſed true reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="1012" facs="tcp:19538:515"/>
him; that ſeeing hee is our father, wee therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues, as becommeth Sons, and be affected with ſuch reuerence towards him, as it becommeth children to be affected towards their father, eſpecially being adopted children, and vnworthy of Gods bleſſinges and benefites. 4. <hi>In regard of confidence,</hi> that the ſame be raiſed in vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may be aſſured that we ſhal be heard. For ſeeing god is our father, &amp; euen ſo louing a father vnto vs, <hi>that he hath giuen his onlie begotten Son for vs to death: how then ſhal he not giue vs together with him all things neceſſary to our ſaluation?</hi> 5. <hi>For a memorial of our creation.</hi> Now God wil hear thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſo pray; becauſe in them he obtaineth the end of his bleſſings and benefites. Obiection. <hi>Jt is the part of a father to denie nothing vnto his children. But God denieth many things to vs. Therefore he is not our father.</hi> Aunſwere. It is the part of a father to deny nothing vnto his children, that is, which is neceſſary for them.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt willeth vs to call God <hi>our Father,</hi> not my Father. 1 <hi>Thereby to raiſe in vs a confidence and full perſwaſion that wee ſhall he heard.</hi> For becauſe the whole church doth with one conſent pray vnto him, he doth not reiect her, but heareth her praiers, according to this promiſe of our Lorde: <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middeſt of them.</hi> Obiection. <hi>But oftentimes thou praieſt at home, the Church not beeing priuie thereunto.</hi> Aunſwere. The Godly, and the whole Church pray for themſelues, and all the members, with an affection and deſire. Loue &amp; deſire is an habitual qualitie of the ſoul, remaining alſo when thou ſleepeſt; it is not a paſſion quickly fleeting or paſſing a way. And this alſo maketh much for the enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in vs; becauſe, as hath been ſaide, God doth not reiect the whole Church. 2 <hi>To admoniſh vs of mutual loue,</hi> wherewith Chriſtians being endued muſt pray one for another. And therefore doth he by this worde, in the very proeme &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the praier, admoniſh vs of mutual loue, wherwith we muſt be affected towards our neighbor. 1 <hi>Becauſe there is no true praying without the true loue of our neighbor: neither can we be perſwaded that God heareth vs.</hi> For if wee approch vnto God, not accounting the ſonnes of God for our breethren; neither will hee then account vs for his ſonnes. 2 <hi>Becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:19538:515"/>
without the loue of our neighbour there is no true faith, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith there is no true praier. For whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the proeme is, <hi>Which art in Heauen,</hi> that is, Heauenly. <hi>Heauen</hi> heere ſignifieth the habitation of God, and the holy Angels, and bleſſed men. And <hi>God is ſaide to dwell there,</hi> becauſe there God is more glorious, than in this world, &amp; doth alſo there immediatly ſhew and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lorde willeth vs to call him <hi>our Father, which is in Heauen,</hi> 1 <hi>Thereby to ſhewe the oppoſition and contrarietie of earthlie fathers, and this Father:</hi> that ſo we ſhould thinke that God raigneth in Heauenly glory and Maieſty, and is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not earthly, but Heauenly, euen he, 1 <hi>Who ſitteth in heauen.</hi> 2 <hi>Who ruleth, and gouerneth there by his prouidence the whole world by him created.</hi> 3 <hi>Who is voide of all corruption and change.</hi> 4 <hi>Who alſo doth there eſpeciallie manifeſt himſelfe before the Angels; and doeth there ſhewe what a Father he is, how good, and how mightie and rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>To raiſe vp in vs a confidence that God heareth vs;</hi> for if he be our Father, and one that is endued with exceeding goodneſſe, which he eſpecially manifeſteth and declareth in Heauen: Then will he alſo giue vs all thinges neceſſarie to ſaluation. If this our Father be Lord in Heauen, and ſo omnipotent, whereby he is able to helpe vs: then is hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble moſt eaſilie to giue vs thoſe good things which we aske of him. 3 <hi>To raiſe a reuerence of him in vs;</hi> ſeeing this our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſo great a Lorde, that is, heauenly, who raigneth euerie-where, <hi>who is able to caſt both bodie and ſoule into Hell fire:</hi> let vs then reuerence ſuch a Lorde, and approch vnto him with exceeding ſubmiſſion both of minde and bodie. 4 <hi>That we cal on him in feruencie of ſpirit.</hi> 5 <hi>That the mind of him that worſhippeth be lifted vp to heauenlie things.</hi> 6 <hi>That heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges bee deſired.</hi> 7 <hi>That the errour of Ethnikes might be met withall, who thinke that they may adore and worſhip God in creatures.</hi> 8 <hi>To admoniſh vs, that wee are not to direct our praiers vnto a certaine place, as in the olde Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let theſe things ſuffice for the firſt part of Chriſts prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Now followeth the ſecond part of the praier, namely the petition, which compriſeth ſix petitions.</p>

The word of <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is here taken in all three ſenſes, as a little after we ſhall vnderſtand.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>To hallow or ſanctifie,</hi> is in Scripture vſed after three waies. 1 <hi>Of vs.</hi> 2 <hi>Of God.</hi> 3 <hi>Of Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Of vs it is affirmed after a double manner:</hi> firſt, <hi>when wee hallow and ſanctifie our ſelues &amp; others.</hi> And <hi>we ſanctifie our ſelues and others,</hi> when (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing externall and outward thinges) we prepare our ſelues and others to glorifie God. For there commeth ſome holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto vs by glorifieng of God, but none to God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, <hi>When we hallowe and ſanctifie God.</hi> Now we ſanctifie God, 1 <hi>When we acknowledge god to be holie:</hi> or when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:19538:516"/>
God to be ſuch, as hee hath declared himſelfe in his word and woorkes; that is, when we know and thinke the ſame of Gods Eſſence, of his wil, &amp; works, of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, goodneſſe, wiſedome, and other his properties, which God in his woorde hath commaunded and reueiled that we ſhould know and thinke of them. Secondly, <hi>When we profeſſe God to be holie, and ſo magnifie him according to his will,</hi> that is, when our confeſſion, whereby we confeſſe god to be holy, is agreeing with his diuine will. And then is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with his diuine will, when we profeſſe the Holines of God both in minde, and woorde, and alſo in deede and woorkes. Thirdlie, <hi>When we refer the true doctrine, knowledge, and profeſſion of Gods holineſſe, and likewiſe our praiers and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and euen our whole life vnto that end, whereunto wee ought, and whither God hath commanded it to bee referred,</hi> namely, to the glorie and woorſhip of God himſelfe. And ſo wee are ſaid to ſanctifie God after the ſelfeſame three waies, after which a thing is ſaide to be holy. Wherefore, <hi>when we deſire that the name of God may be hallowed or ſanctified,</hi> wee deſire, 1 <hi>That God would illighten vs with the knowledge of his holineſſe.</hi> 2 <hi>That he would giue vs a minde to profeſſe the ſame in wordes &amp; deeds,</hi> or, that he would giue vs faith &amp; repentance, whereby we may glorifie him, and whereby wee may ſeuer him from Idols and prophane things: or laſtly, that he would regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs; and this, firſt <hi>by knowledge,</hi> then <hi>by profeſſion,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>by conformitie,</hi> according to this his commandement. <hi>Be yee holie, euen as I alſo am holie.</hi> 3 <hi>That hee would giue vs a mind to profeſſe that holineſſe of his diuine Name to his own praiſe and glorie.</hi> Hither may be referred that of Auſten: <hi>Giue what thou commaundeſt, and commaund what thou wilt, and then ſhalt thou not commaund in vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obiection. <hi>God is holie enough, there is no cauſe therefore why we ſhould deſire that he be hallowed or ſanctified.</hi> Aunſwere. God is holy in himſelfe. But wee deſire, that wee may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be holy, and ſo magnifie him. He ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth vs by making vs holy, wee ſanctifie and hallow God himſelfe, when we ſpeake that of him, which he will haue vs to ſpeake and knowe of him. Obiection 2. <hi>What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto vs to do, that ſhould we not deſire another to doe. But it belongeth to vs to hallow and ſanctifie the name of God.</hi> Anſw.
<pb facs="tcp:19538:517"/>
What belongeth vnto vs to doe, that wee ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire another to doe, if ſo we be able by our ſelues, &amp; by our own ſtrength to perfourme it. But we are not able to doe this. Therefore we muſt deſire of God, that he will giue vs ſtrength, wherby his diuine name may be of vs hallowed &amp; ſanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worde hallowing is affirmed of God,</hi> not that hee hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, or that another halloweth him, ſeeing he hath none aboue him, but becauſe he halloweth and ſanctifieth others. <hi>And others he ſanctifieth inwardlie, and outwardly. Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his holie ſpirit. Outwardlie by his woorde. Which he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuateth,</hi> 1 <hi>By ſeparating them from their ſinnes.</hi> 2 <hi>By reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; quickning them by his holie ſpirit.</hi> 3 <hi>By the continuing of both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The ſame worde is affirmed of Chriſt, two waies.</hi> Namely, both paſſiuely, and actiuelie. <hi>Paſſiuelie,</hi> 1 <hi>Becauſe the Word was ordained and conſecrated by the father to the office of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</hi> 2 <hi>Becauſe the humane nature of Chriſt was canſecrated out of that whole lump or maſſe,</hi> that is, was ſelected from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all creatures to the vnion with the <hi>Worde.</hi> 3 <hi>Becauſe his humane nature was preſerued from ſinne for the perfourmance of the Mediatourſhip.</hi> The ſame is alſo affirmed of him <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuelie, becauſe Chriſt is hallowed and ſanctified of vs.</hi> Now it is vſed of him <hi>actiuely, becauſe Chriſt ſanctifieth both himſelfe &amp; others.

                  <p>A <hi>Kingdome,</hi> in general, <hi>is a certaine forme of ciuil gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the ſoueraigntie of rule belongeth to ſome one perſon, who is furniſhed with giftes and vertues aboue the reſt, and ruleth ouer al, according to iuſt, honeſt, and certaine Lawes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring obedience, making Laws, defending the good, &amp; puniſhing the bad.</hi> The kingdome of God, <hi>is the ſending of the Son from the father, euen from the beginning of the world, who ſhould ordain and maintaine a miniſterie, and ſhould by the ſame be effectual &amp; forcible in working, ſhould gather a Church by the woorde and the holy ghoſt, out of all mankinde, rule and preſerue the ſame, raiſe it from death, adorne it with heauenly glorie, that ſo God may be all in all, and maie be magnified by the Church of Angels and men for euer.</hi> Out of this definition wee may gather and make theſe partes the kingdome of God. 1. <hi>The ſending of the Sonne our Mediatour.</hi> 2. <hi>The ordaining and maintaining of the miniſterie by Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>The gathering of the church by Chriſt out of mankinde by the voice of the goſpell, and the efficacie of the holy Ghoſt, beginning in vs true faith and repentaunce.</hi> 4. <hi>The perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gouernement of the church.</hi> 5. <hi>The preſeruation thereof in this life, and protection againſt her enemies.</hi> 6. <hi>The caſting awaie of her enemies, into eternal paines.</hi> 7. <hi>The raiſing of the church vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> 8. <hi>The glorifieng of the church in eternall life, when god ſhal be al in al.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="1018" facs="tcp:19538:518"/>Now then, ſeeing we vnderſtand what the kingdome of God is, it is knowen alſo vnto vs, what is conteined in this petition. <hi>Here therefore we deſire,</hi> that God wil by his Son our Mediatour ſent from the very beginning into the woorlde, 1. <hi>Preſerue the miniſterie which he hath ordained.</hi> 2. <hi>Gather his church by the miniſterie of his word, and the woorking of the holie Ghoſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Rule his church gathered, and vs the members thereof with his holy ſpirite, who may conforme vs vnto him, ſoften our hearts, regenerate our wils.</hi> 4. <hi>Defend vs and his whole church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our enemies &amp; tyrants.</hi> 5. <hi>Caſt away his &amp; our enemies into eternal pains, wherewith he maie puniſh them for euer.</hi> 6. <hi>And at length deliuer his church, and glorifie it in the world to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By al this it appeareth, <hi>That this kingdome, which we deſire maie come, is a ſpiritual kingdom:</hi> which alſo the lord himſelfe ſheweth by diuerſe parables in the Euangeliſt; and vnto Pilate he aunſwereth; <hi>My Kingdome is not of this woorlde.</hi> Of the kingdome of Chriſt is it ſaid, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 110.2. <hi>Be thou ruler in the mids of thine enemies.</hi> And furthermore, ſeeing we muſt deſire, that this kingdome may come, and therefore muſt withal deſire our ful deliuery; hereby it is euident, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious a thing it is to bee afraid of the iudgement of God, &amp; the laſt day of doome: becauſe ſuch as doe this, ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues not to bee godly, neither to deſire their full deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and glorifieng. Obiection. <hi>But terrible wil the daie of iudgement be: Therfore we are not to deſire it.</hi> Anſwer. It wilbe terrible, but to the wicked onely. For vnto the godly it is ſaid, <hi>Lift vp your heads.</hi> Therefore Chriſt wil haue them to reioice, and to wiſh for the approching of that day. For what thou reioiceſt in, that alſo thou wiſheſt. <hi>Come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Obiection. <hi>That which commeth neither ſooner nor later for our praiers, is in vaine deſired of vs, and therefore we are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. But the kingdome of god, that is, the deliuerie of the church from all euils and miſeries ſhall come neither ſooner nor later, for our praiers, than god hath decreed it. Therefore wee are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the deliuerie of the church.</hi> Aunſwere. The Maior is falſe. For ſo then may we conclude or reaſon of al thoſe benefits which remaine in the counſel and purpoſe of God.

This deliuery of vs and the whole church we muſt craue of the Lord with daily prayers: if ſo we wil bee our ſelues alſo at length deliuered together with the Church. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, for this cauſe alſo muſt we deſire this deliuerie, that then that iudgement may bee of a ſauing force vnto vs, wherein the Lord will fullie deliuer his Elect and choſen. God will alſo therefore haue vs deſire an haſtning &amp; ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this day, that there may be an end of wickednes &amp; impieties: &amp; that all the godlie may reſt from their labors. But ſo notwithſtanding muſt we deſire and craue all theſe things, that we ſubiect and ſubmit our wil to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord, or his diuine will.

Wee deſire both in this petition, to wit, both the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kingdome of God, and the conſummation thereof.

                  <p n="2">2 We deſire <hi>the performance of the deitie and calling, both of all in generall, and of each in ſeuerall:</hi> that namely wee may rightly and duely perfourme the duetie committed vnto vs, whether common, or proper, that euery one may cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerue god in his calling, and execute his will.

                     <hi>3</hi> Of whom Gods will is done in Heauen.</head>
                  <p>IN Heauen the will of God is doone, 1. <hi>Of the ſonne him ſelfe, who doth all the will of his Father.</hi> 2. <hi>Of the Angels, and bleſſed men. Of the Angels</hi> the will of God is ſo done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as that euerie Angel ſtandeth in the preſence of God being readie to doe whatſoeuer God commaundeth. They doe both his generall, and his ſpeciall will: none ſeaſeth vpon that which belongeth to another; none is aſhamed to ſerue, although we anoy them with the noyſome ſauour of our ſinnes, and offend God. <hi>They are miniſtring ſpirites,</hi> Hebr. 1.14. Nowe Chriſt addeth heere, <hi>as in Heauen,</hi> 1. <hi>To preſcribe and draw vs a patterne and example of perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we muſt ſtriue.</hi> 2. <hi>That by this deſire of perfection, we maie be aſſured that God will giue vs here the beginning, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the life come.</hi> Obiection. <hi>That which is alwaies done,
<pb facs="tcp:19538:521"/>
&amp; ſhall certainlie come to paſſe, though we deſire it not; the ſame is not to be deſired. The will of God is doone alwaies, and ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be doone, though we deſire it not. Therefore it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</hi> Aunſvvere. The Minor of this reaſon vve denie. For it is falſe, 1. <hi>As concerning the calling and vocation of euerie man;</hi> becauſe they that deſire not, that they may be able in their vocation to doe their duety rightly, faithfully, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſame ſhal neuer doe it. 2. It is falſe alſo, <hi>as concerning gods decrees:</hi> becauſe god hath decreed many euents, but yet ſo, as that hee hath alſo decreed the meanes of comming thereunto. There is alſo a fallacy in the Maior propoſition, putting that for a cauſe which is no cauſe; becauſe <hi>we do not therefore deſire that gods wil be done, as if it ſhould not bee done if we ſhould not deſire it:</hi> but we deſire it for other cauſes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all euents may be good and proſperous vnto vs. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſhal not be good vnto vs, neither tending to our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, except vve ſubmit them to the vvill of god; ſo that vvee deſire that only to be done, vvhich he hath decreed &amp; vvill haue done. Reply. <hi>The decrees of god are vnchangeable.</hi> Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver. The Decrees of god, not only as touching the euents or ends, but alſo as touching the meanes, are vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hee hath decreed to giue the ende, but by the meane, vvhich is of this condition, that vvee deſire it and pray for it.</p>
                  <p>Obiection. <hi>God wil haue our Parentes to die; Therefore wee muſt deſire that they maie die.</hi> Anſwere. I deny the conſequent of this reaſon: for vve muſt ſubiect our ſelues to the vvill of god, and deſire that vvhich hee commaundeth vs to deſire. So neither doth this follovv: <hi>The church ſhall bee ſubiect vnto the croſſe: Therefore J wil praie for affliction.</hi> Neither yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may it be concluded, that our vvil diſagreeth from gods will: becauſe thou deſireſt vvith that end, whereby thou muſt deſire her deliuerie. God vvill haue our parents to dy, &amp; yet vvil he not haue vs to vviſh their death: god wil haue his church to be vnder the croſſe, &amp; yet he wil not haue vs to deſire her croſſe, but to pray for her deliuery, &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to beare it, if it afflict her. In like maner, God wil not in this life giue vs perfect deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, &amp; yet wil he haue vs to vviſh it, &amp; euery mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to deſire that we may be wholy deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin. Wherefore ſome things are to be deſired,
<pb facs="tcp:19538:522"/>
which God wil not doe, &amp; ſome things, which hee wil doe, are not to be deſired, but patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to be ſuffered. But neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it belongeth nothing at al vnto vs to ſearch, what thinges God hath decreed, ſeeing we haue this preſcribed vs for a rule, that wee aske &amp; deſire, but with a condition of gods wil.</p>
                  <p>Obiection. <hi>Vnpoſſible thinges are not to bee deſired: for hee that deſireth thinges vnpoſſible, deſireth in vaine. But to deſire that Gods wil be done in earth, as it is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that we maie do our duetie, like as do the Angels in heauen; is, to deſire a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; yea it is, to deſire that which is contrarie to Gods decree: Therefore that is not to be deſired, ſeeing God will haue this to be our ſtate in the life to come, not in this life.</hi> Aunſwere 1. The Maior is to be diſtinguiſhed. Vnpoſſible thinges are not to be deſired, except God will at length graunt them to thoſe that deſire them: but God will giue the performance of his will to thoſe that deſire it, and that in this life as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the beginning thereof, &amp; in the life to come as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the conſummation &amp; ful accompliſhment. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this conſummation is to be deſired, and the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie is patiently to bee ſuffered in this life. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation is therefore to bee deſired in this life, that wee may at length obtaine it; becauſe he that dooth not nowe deſire it, ſhal doubtles at no time obtaine it. It is one thing not to be able to attaine vnto this conſummation; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing not to deſire it. 2. We denie the Minor: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is a fallacie, putting that for a cauſe, which is no cauſe. For neither doe wee deſire that in this life the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perfection of our obedience towards God may bee accompliſhed, but that heere may bee wrought the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and continuaunce, and encreaſe thereof, and after this life our obedience being here augmented with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual encreaſes, may bee at length perfected, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that ſo we then may no leſſe doe the will of God, than it is alwaies doone of the Angels in heauen. When therefore we pray, <hi>That Gods will bee doone in earth, as it is in heauen,</hi> this particle, <hi>as,</hi> dooth not betoken the degree, but the kind of doing it, which is the beginning of performing Gods will. And for theſe cauſes alſo dooth Chriſt ad theſe words, <hi>as in heauen,</hi> that it may be as it were an example of
<pb facs="tcp:19538:522"/>
patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which we ought to folow: &amp; that he might propoſe a goale &amp; mark vnto vs, whereunto we ought to ſtriue. We are to obſerue here <hi>the difference which is betweene theſe three former petitions. In the firſt we deſire</hi> ſanctification, or the true knowledge, &amp; worſhip of god. <hi>Jn the ſecond,</hi> the gathering, preſeruation, and gouernement of the church: that God would rule vs by his ſpirit, defend and protect vs, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from al euils both of crime and paine. <hi>Jn the third,</hi> that euery one particularly in their vocation may obey god, that is, that euery man be with diligence occupied in his proper duty &amp; function, and direct al things to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, &amp; take wel in worth whatſoeuer God ſendeth on him. Moreouer, <hi>theſe three petitions are ſo linked together, that one conſiſteth not without the other; and like as the third petition ſerueth for the ſecond, ſo dooth the ſecond for the firſt.</hi> For the name of the Lord is not hallowed or ſanctified, except his kingdome come; and the kingdom of God doth not come, except thoſe means be put whereby it is aduaunced. And thoſe meanes are the duties of euery particular mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and vocation. Wherefore we deſire that God will bury in vs euil luſts and deſires, &amp; that himſelfe alone will work in vs by his ſpirit: that ſo we beeing furniſhed and vphelde with this his diuine grace, may fulfil our duty, &amp; be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto our calling.</p>

                     <hi>WE muſt deſire corporall bleſſings,</hi> 1. <hi>In reſpect of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,</hi> which may ſuffice vs, albeit there were no other cauſe. And we haue a commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hereof from God, both general, and ſpecial. For chriſt ſaith in generall, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7 7. <hi>Aske, and yee ſhal receiue.</hi> And a ſpecial comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement he ſetteth down before this forme of praier which himſelfe preſcribed vnto vs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. <hi>After this maner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praie ye:</hi> by which commandment Chriſt alſo willeth vs to deſire <hi>Bread,</hi> or corporal bleſſinges.

                     <hi>COrporal bleſſings are to be deſired,</hi> 1. <hi>with a confidence and ful perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods fauor:</hi> becauſe otherwiſe god might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that vve are not of them, vnto vvhom he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe things. 2. <hi>With a conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods wil &amp; pleaſure,</hi> that is, vvith a ſubmitting of our vvill to gods vvill: becauſe god hath promiſed theſe bleſſings not vvith any determined or definit circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. 3. <hi>With faith &amp; belief of gods hearing vs,</hi> ſo that we certainly beleeue that God will giue vs ſo much as ſufficeth. 4 <hi>To this end, as therby to ſerue god, &amp; our neighbor.</hi> They who deſire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not after this ſort, are not heard, that is, ſuch things are not giuen them as may tend to their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and albeit they receiue that which they deſire, yet are they not indeed heard of god, becauſe thoſe things which they receiue are not good and profitable vnto their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We are here to obſerue, that <hi>the Lorde commaunded vs in generall to pray for corporall bleſſings, neither hath defined in his worde, what corporall bleſſings he will giue vs, and hath with this condition promiſed to giue them vs, namely, as the ſaftie and ſaluation of euerie one, and the manifeſtation of his glorie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> The reaſons hereof are theſe. 1 <hi>Becauſe we oftentimes know not what we aske, &amp; what is expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs:</hi> And often we aske things neither profitable to vs, nor ſeruing for Gods glorie, or the ſaluation of others. But God knoweth beſt, what is conuenient and meete for vs for the manifeſting of his glory, and for the furdering of our owne ſaluation. Seeing then we often erre in deſiring corporall bleſſings, God giueth none other vnto vs, than ſuch as he knoweth to be meet and profitable for vs. <hi>But ſpirituall bleſſings god hath promiſed not in general onelie, but both ſpeciallie, &amp; ſimply, without anie condition annexed.</hi> For they are ſimply profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto vs, and god himſelfe hath preſcribed the manner and way which we are to folow in them; ſo that in deſiring them we cannot erre. For what things god hath ſimply promiſed vs, the ſame vve ought ſimply to deſire: &amp; vvhat things he hath ſpecially and abſolutely promiſed vs, the ſame muſt vve in like manner abſolutely aske and deſire. So muſt vve ſimplie deſire the holy ghoſt, becauſe god
<pb n="1030" facs="tcp:19538:524"/>
hath ſimply and expreſſely promiſed that hee vvill giue the holy ghoſt to euerie one that deſireth him. 2 <hi>That wee maie learn to be content with thoſe things which we haue receiued of the Lord, and ſubmit alwaies our will to his pleaſure and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> So god alſo for this cauſe hath commanded vs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to deſire corporall beſſings, that ſuch a deſiring of thoſe bleſſings, may be an exerciſe of our faith and of the ſubiection and ſubmitting of our vvill, to the vvill of god.</p>

But many other things are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for vs. Therefore we deſire them alſo vnder the name of <hi>Bread.</hi> And this Hebrewe Synecdoche is found often in the ſacred Bible, as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Jn the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate bread.</hi> Pſal. 41.9. <hi>Hee which did eate of my bread hath lifted vp the heele againſt me.</hi> Furdermore chriſt did not only compriſe things neceſſarie themſelues vnder the name of <hi>Bread,</hi> but alſo the profitable vſe of them.

                  <p>THIS queſtion together with the next enſuing, ariſeth out of the former queſtions. For when wee are willed to deſire onely <hi>dailie Bread,</hi> and that <hi>this daie,</hi> it ſeemeth at the firſt ſight, that it is not lawful either to deſire riches, or to put vp any thing for the morrow. But <hi>it is verilie lawfull to deſire riches,</hi> if, taking away all ambiguity and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the worde, wee vnderſtand by the name of riches things neceſſary for the ſuſteina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life: As the Epicure defined <hi>riches, To bee a pouertie agreeable to the Law of nature.</hi> This definition is good. And if we ſo take the name of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, riches are doubtles to be deſired of god, in aſmuch as we ought to deſire ſuch things as are neceſſary for nature, and our place, and function whereunto god hath called vs. The reaſon hereof is, <hi>becauſe theſe neceſſarie things, or riches, are dailie Bread, which we ought to deſire.</hi> They are alſo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe defined, <hi>To bee an aboundance and plentie ouer and aboue thinges neceſſarie.</hi> So Craſſus (ſurnamed the Rich) ſaid that <hi>no man was rich, but he who was able to maintaine an armie with his reuenues.</hi> If wee take riches in this ſenſe, riches are not at all to be deſired of God; becauſe Salomon in the perſon of al the godly ſaith, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Giue me not pouerty, nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> by which wordes the ſpirite of god alſo by Salomon teacheth vs to pray againſt riches, that is, aboundance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue things neceſſarie. Hither belongeth alſo that of Paul, 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into tentations and ſnares, and into manie fooliſh, and noyſome luſtes, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction,</hi> for which cauſe riches are called <hi>Thornes,</hi> by Chriſt. But contrariwiſe; <hi>Godlineſſe is great gaine,
<pb facs="tcp:19538:525"/>
if a man be content with that he hath.</hi> But notwithſtanding, if god hath giuen vs any thing, beſide thoſe things which are neceſſarie for vs, let vs doe our diligence to vſe them well. And to this end, firſt, <hi>we muſt take heede that we repoſe not our confidence in them.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Wee muſt conſider that wee are Gods ſtewards,</hi> who hath committed theſe riches vnto vs to employ and beſtowe well, and that by this means he hath laide a burden vpon vs, and therefore ſhall wee one day render an account to god of our ſtewardſhip, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>

                     <hi>IT is doubtles lawfull for to put vp ſome thing for time to come,</hi> according to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt, <hi>Gather vp the broken meat which remaineth, that nothing be loſt.</hi> Hither belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all ſuch precepts and commandements as ſpeake of parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and frugalitie.

Likewiſe, to the preſeruation of the Church, to aide the common wealth when neede ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and to beſtow ſomewhat on the poore and our nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy brethren.

                  <p>Now ſhal aunſwere eaſily be made to ſuch obiections as may be oppoſed againſt this petition. 1 Obiection. <hi>That which we deſire, is not ours. Bread is ours. Wherefore we neede not to deſire bread.</hi> Aunſwere. There is a diuerſe ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the woorde <hi>(ours.)</hi> For in the Maior propoſition it ſignifieth a thing which we haue in our own power: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a farre other manner is Bread ours, as hath bin before declared. 2 Obiection. <hi>Chriſt willeth vs to deſire Daily Bread; Therfore it is not lawful to put vp any thing againſt the Morrow, but we are to care only for the preſent day.</hi> Againe, <hi>he willeth vs, not to deſire Bread againſt the morrow, but to deſire Bread for This daie: therefore they doe ill, who gather any thing for future vſes.</hi>

Aunſwere. This is a fallacie putting that for a cauſe, which is no cauſe. Chriſt willeth vs to deſire daily bread, &amp; This day; and therefore wee muſt alſo deſire thinges neceſſarie of him for our life for euerie day, this day, to morrow, and ſo long as wee liue: but hee meaneth not hereby as if hee would not haue vs labour for the morrow, or not to put vp any thing for the morrow, or to caſt away thoſe bleſſings which he hath already giuen vs ſufficing for the morrowe. Chriſt indeed otherwhere commandeth, <hi>That wee care not for the morrow,</hi> but ſo he forbiddeth vs to thinke of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe with diſtruſtfulneſſe, but not with praiers &amp; labours. Wherefore the Lord will not that wee put vp nothing for hereafter, but firſt, <hi>that we be content with things preſent,</hi> all diſtruſt, couetouſneſſe, vnlawfull getting &amp; diſobedience being ſet apart and baniſhed. 2 <hi>That we place not our truſt in things neceſſarie giuen vs of God:</hi> but knowe and certainlie perſwade our ſelues that thoſe benefits which haue beene and are giuen, come vnto vs from the hande of God, and that they are not otherwiſe good and profitable vnto vs, except his bleſsing come to them. 3 <hi>That wee conſider our ſelues alwaies to ſtand in neede of Gods bleſſing.</hi> And wee muſt withall beware, that wee preſcribe not to god, what he is to giue vs.</p>

                  <p>THE creditor is ſaid to <hi>Remit</hi> the debter, when he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requireth the debt of him, nor puniſheth him. <hi>Remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> is, That god wil not impute any ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, but doth receiue vs into fauour, pronounceth vs iuſt and righteous, and accounteth vs for his ſons, of his meere and free mercy, for Chriſts ſatisfaction performed by him for vs, imputed vnto vs, &amp; apprehended of vs by faith: And that therefore hee wil not puniſh vs for our ſin, but endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs with iuſtice, and euerlaſting life, becauſe the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinne taketh away the puniſhment thereof. For ſin and puniſhment, are correlatiues: put ſin, and you put pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; take away ſinne, and puniſhment is alſo taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

For we deſire remiſſion of ſinnes, for the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, for which they are remitted vnto vs, and therefore our ſins are not remitted vs with any breach of gods iuſtice, becauſe they are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs with recompence made for them.

We remit not. Therefore we are not remitted.</hi> Aunſwere. He that remitteth not fully and perfectly, is notwithſtanding remitted, ſo that hee remitte truely and ſincerely. Obiection. 2. <hi>Chriſt willed vs to deſire, that God will ſo remitte vs our ſinnes, as wee remitte our debters. But wee doe not perfectlie remit our debters. Therefore he willed vs to deſire, that god wil not perfectly remitte vs our ſinnes.</hi> Anſ. This is a fallacy of ſpeech deceiuing by miſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtring a word. For the particle <hi>(as)</hi> in this petition dooth not ſignifie the degree of remiſſion, or a compariſon of our remiſſion with that remiſſion, wherewith God remitteth vs our ſinnes, but it ſignifieth the kinde of remiſſion, namely the trueth and ſincerity of our remiſſion, whereby wee forgiue others from our hart, and with a readie wil of forgiuing them: or, (to ſpeak ſhorter) heere is not made a compariſon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to degrees, but according to the truth of the thing, or according to the trueth of remiſſion: ſo that the meaning is, ſo perfectly God remitteth vs our ſinnes, as we truly and certainely remitte and forgiue our neighbour: or, Forgiue vs our debts, becauſe we forgiue our debters. Reply. <hi>Then is our remiſſion of others the cauſe why God remitteth vs.</hi> Anſwere. This a fallacy putting that for a cauſe, which is no cauſe. For our remiſſion, wherwith we forgiue others, though not perfectly, yet ſincerely, is only an argument and teſtimony vnto vs, that god wil remit vs our ſinnes. For our remiſſion and forgiuing of others cannot merit. 1. <hi>Becauſe it is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> 2. <hi>Albeit it were perfect, yet ſhould it not merit, becauſe what we now perfourme, that we owe vnto god.</hi> For were it ſo that we did now perfourme perfect obedience to god, yet were wee bound of duty to perfourme it. Reply. <hi>But neuertheles yet here is betokened an equalitie of remiſſion in vs and god.</hi> Aunſwere
<pb facs="tcp:19538:528"/>
Not an equality, but a likeneſſe and ſimilitude of the kinde of remiſſion. Obiection. 3. <hi>He that remembreth iniuries, and is deſirous of reuenge, doth not truly remit and forgiue. But we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member iniuries, and are deſirous of reuenge. Therefore we doe not truly remit and forgiue.</hi> Aunſwere. They that remember iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that is, without a reſiſtance and diſlike of this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, or with a yeelding thereto, doe not truely remit. If then wee withſtand and reſiſt the remnauntes of ſinnes, which as yet cleaue faſt vnto vs, and doe not yeelde vnto them, nothing hindereth why wee maie not bee ſaide to remitte others truelie and from our heart, and ſo alſo to attaine vnto that, in regarde where-of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>(as)</hi> was added of Chriſt, to wit, (which before alſo we mentioned) to deſire and pray rightly. Now we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray and deſire in faith and repentance, both which this petition confirmeth. Faith is confirmed and ſtrengthned by this petition, becauſe when we truely remit our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we may and ought certainly to reſolue, that our ſins are alſo remitted vs, and ſo haue we a good conſcience, &amp; are aſſured that we are heard, according to this promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Jf ye doe forgiue men their treſpaſſes, your heauenlie father will alſo forgiue you.</hi> True repentance alſo is confirmed and increaſed in vs by this petition. For by this petition we are prouoked and incited to true repentaunce, the chiefe part whereof is the loue of our neighbour. For if we will be forgiuen, we muſt forgiue others. Both cauſes are conteined in the word of Chriſt before alleaged out of Matthewe; as alſo in the reſt which are preſently added in the ſame place in Matthewe, by way of oppoſition. <hi>If yee doe forgiue men their treſpaſſes, your heauenlie father will alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue you;</hi> that is, aſſure your ſelues alſo that your heauenly father heareth you. In which worde is comprehended the confirmation of our faith. <hi>But if yee doe not forgiue men their treſpaſſes, no more will your father forgiue you your treſpaſſes.</hi> In theſe words is added a ſpurre to repentance. Obiection. 4. <hi>Paul obtained remiſſion, neither yet did he forgiue al of them their treſpaſſer; becauſe he ſaith,</hi> 2. Tim. 4.14. <hi>Alexander the Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith hath done me much euil: the Lord rewarde him according to his woorkes. Therefore it is not neceſſarie that we ſhoulde forgiue.</hi> Anſwere. There is a threefold remiſſion or forgiuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Of
<pb facs="tcp:19538:528"/>
reuenge.</hi> This belongeth to all men: becauſe all men ought to remit and forgiue reuenge. Hereof ſpeaketh this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this Paul did forgiue Alexander. 2. <hi>Of puniſhment.</hi> This, as all can not inflict, ſo neither can all remit; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they alſo, vnto whom yet the ſame otherwiſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ought alwaies to remit this, but onely for certaine cauſes. For God will haue the execution of his iuſtice and Lawe.

Wherefore we are alſo to reteine a true iudgement concerning others.

                  <p>
                     <hi>THERE are two cauſes of temptations. The one is from God: the other from the Diuel and the fleſh. The temptation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God tempteth vs,</hi> is a tryal of our faith, godlines, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the Croſſe, and other encumbrances, which are oppoſed to euery one, that our faith, patience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie may be manifeſted and made knowen both to our ſelues and others. So <hi>God is ſaid to haue tempted Abraham, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Job, Dauid. The temptation, whereby the Diuel, and our fleſh, and the wicked alſo tempt vs,</hi> is euerie ſoliciting to ſinne,
<pb n="1040" facs="tcp:19538:529"/>
which ſoliciting it ſelfe alſo is ſinne. So the Diuel tempted Iob, that hee might ſeduce and withdrawe him from God, whom hee had before loued, and ſerued: albeit the matter fell out otherwiſe than the Diuel would haue it. <hi>Here is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the name of temptation that temptation of God, that is, the trial of our faith, godlines, and patience,</hi> which God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by whatſoeuer lets or hinderances of our ſaluation, as by all euils, by the Diuel, the fleſh, our luſts, the world, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, calamities, the croſſe, that our faith, conſtancie, and hope may bee made knowen vnto our ſelues &amp; others. Obiection. <hi>But God tempteth no man.</hi> Aunſwere. <hi>God tempteth no man,</hi> that is, by ſoliciting him to ſinne, or euil: but hee tempteth by proouing and trying vs. <hi>The Diuels, the woorld, our fleſh tempt vs,</hi> that is, ſolicite vs to euils, and withdrawe vs from God. But God as he tempteth no man, and yet is ſaid to haue tempted Abraham, Iob, Dauid, that is, to haue tried their faith and conſta<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ie by afflictions, &amp; the croſſe: ſo by the ſame he trieth our faith, hope, patience, loue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, conſtancy, whether we wil or no worſhip &amp; ſerue him alſo in afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we eaſily vnderſtand, <hi>ſeeing temptation is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Diuel, &amp; to the corrupt luſts and inclinations of men, in what ſenſe God maie bee ſaide to tempt, or not to tempt men. For Satan tempteth,</hi> both offering occaſions of ſinning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and inſtigating within to ſinne, thereby to drawe men headlong into deſtruction, and to reproch God. <hi>Corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations tempt: becauſe they bend and are prone to actions by god forbidden. But god tempteth not to deſtroy vs, nor to cauſe vs to ſin, but to trie &amp; exerciſe vs,</hi> when either hee ſendeth calamity vpon vs, or permitteth the Diuel, or men, or our fleſh, to prouoke &amp; inuite vs to ſin, hiding for a while his grace, &amp; efficacy in preſeruing &amp; ruling vs, that our faith &amp; conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy may be made more known &amp; apparant, not verily vnto god himſelf (as who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting knoweth what &amp; how much it is, and how much alſo hereafter it ſhall bee by his fauour and bleſſing) but vnto our ſelues and others, that ſo alſo a truſt &amp; full perſuaſion of gods preſence &amp; protection, may be confirmed in vs by the examples of our deliueraunce, and in others a deſire of folowing our example may be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, through the beholding of our perſeuerance, and that

in al of vs maie be raiſed and ſtirred vp true gratitude and thankefulnes towards god, who deliuereth his out of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>God tempteth Abraham commaunding him to ſacrifice his ſonne Jſaack.</hi> Exod. 15. <hi>He is ſaid to haue tempted the people with want of water.</hi> Exod. 16. <hi>Hee commandeth Manna to be gathered, as much as was ſufficient for euery daie, that hee might tempt, or prooue the people, whether they woulde walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Lawe, or no.</hi> Deutr. 13. <hi>Hee is ſaid to tempt the people by falſe Prophetes, that he might know, whether they loued him with al their heart, and with al their ſoule.</hi> 2. Chron. 32. <hi>Jn the embaſſage of the Princes of Babel, god left Hezechia to tempt, or try him, and to know al that was in his heart.</hi> Wherefore this praier, which chriſt taught vs, <hi>Lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euil,</hi> ſpeaketh not ſimply of al trial &amp; manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of our faith and godlineſſe, vnto which alſo Dauid offereth himſelfe of his owne accord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. ſaying, <hi>Proue me O Lord, and trie me: examine my reines and mine heart.</hi> And Saint Iames ſpeaketh not of our triall, but of our incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſinne, cap. 1.13. <hi>Let no man ſaie when hee is tempted, J am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with euil, neither tempteth he anie man. But euery man is tempted when he is drawn awaie by his owne concupiſcenſe and is entiſed. Then when luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth foorth ſinne: and ſinne when it is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo hereby manifeſt, <hi>how god puniſheth the wicked, or chaſtiſeth or tempteth the godlie by euil ſpirites, neither yet is hee the cauſe or partaker of thoſe ſinnes, which the diuels commit.</hi> For, that by the wicked the wicked are puniſhed, or the good chaſtiſed, or exerciſed, it is the righteous and holy work of Gods diuine will: but that the wicked execute the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God by ſinning, that commeth not ſo to paſſe by any fault of god himſelf, but through the proper corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wicked, and ſuch as themſelues haue purchaſed, god neither willing, nor allowing, nor working, nor furthering their ſinne, but in his moſt iuſt iudgement only permitting it, when exequuting and accompliſhing by them his owne work and counſel, either he reueileth not at al his wil vnto them, or moueth not their will, to haue his reueiled will as the ende and leuill of their action. This difference of the
<pb n="1042" facs="tcp:19538:530"/>
works of God, &amp; the diuel, &amp; euen Gods working of his iuſt work by the Diuel, but permitting only the ſinne of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, is euidently confirmed by the ſtory of Iob, cap. 1. &amp; 2. where God purpoſeth to try Iob, but the Diuell to deſtroie him. The ſame is likewiſe confirmed by the ſtory of Achab 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. and by that prophecy of the Apoſtle concerning Antichriſt. 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. where the Diuel ſeduceth men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, and God wil haue them to be ſeduced thereby to puniſh them, and ſuffereth the Diuel by ſinning to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and fulfil his wil.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WHEN god is ſaid to lead vs into temptation,</hi> it is meant, that God according to his moſt iuſt will and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment trieth vs. Now, <hi>to lead vs into temptation, wherewith the Diuel tempteth vs,</hi> is, that God permitteth the diuel to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite vs. <hi>Lead vs not into temptation,</hi> that is, Suffer vs not to be tempted aboue our power: neither ſuffer the diuell ſo to tempt vs, that either we ſinne, or wholy reuoult from thee. Obiection. <hi>Temptations which are good in reſpect of god, are euil in reſpect of the diuel, and yet notwithſtanding into them doth god lead vs: Therefore god is the cauſe of ſinne.</hi> Aunſwere. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conteineth a fallacy of the accident. They are ſinnes in reſpect of the diuell, becauſe hee will thereby allure vs to ſins: in reſpect of God they are not ſinnes, becauſe they are a trial, and a reclaiming of vs from ſinnes; as alſo, becauſe they are a confirmation and ſtrengthening of our faith. Wherefore as temptations are trials, chaſtiſementes, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes, they are ſent of God: but as they are euill, and ſins, God wil them not, becauſe, to wil them, is, to approoue and work them. Now we here in this petition pray againſt both, (which alſo wee briefly touched before) namely our trial, &amp; allurement or ſoliciting to ſinne. For we deſire firſt, that God wil not tempt vs to try vs, but yet with a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his wil &amp; pleaſure, &amp; if he do tempt vs, yet that he wil not tempt vs aboue our ſtrength: &amp; that alſo he will giue vs ſtrength. Secondly, we deſire, that he wil not ſuffer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, or the world, or our owne fleſh to ſolicite vs to ſinne; or if he ſuffer them, that yet himſelfe wil bee preſent with vs, that we fal not wholy into ſinnes.</p>

                     <hi>THIS petition is neceſsarie,</hi> 1. <hi>In reſpect of the multitude and power of our enemies, and the greatnes of euils, and our owne weaknes and infirmitie.</hi> 2. <hi>In reſpect of the former petition, for the obteining thereof:</hi> becauſe our ſinnes are not remitted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we perſiſt in faith and repentance. If then we wil that God remit and pardon vs our ſinnes, wee muſt ſtand ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in faith and repentaunce: but ſteadfaſt wee ſhall not ſtand, if we bee tempted aboue our ſtrength, if wee fal into ſinnes, if laſtly we reuoult from God himſelfe. Obiection. <hi>We are not to praie againſt ſuch things as are good, and profitable for vs. The temptations of god, as trials, diſeaſes, pouertie, ſending of falſe Prophetes, are good things, and profitable vnto vs: wee are not therefore to praie againſt the temptations of god.</hi> Aunſwere. The Minor conteineth a fallacy of the accident. Wee are not to pray againſt ſuch things as are good and profitable, that is, which are by themſelues profitable or good. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, trials, croſſes, and other temptations are by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="1044" facs="tcp:19538:531"/>
euil and vnprofitable, and not good. But yet they are good, and profite vs onely by an accident: which accident is the mercie of God accompaning them, without which they are not only not profitable, but alſo a part of death, &amp; a moſt preſent way to death both temporall, and eternall. <hi>Wherefore as afflictions and croſſes are euil by themſelues, ſo farre foorth wee praie againſt them; but as they are good and profitable vnto vs that beleeue, ſo we praie not againſt them;</hi> or, wee praie not againſt that good which concurreth with afflictions &amp; the croſſe, but againſt the croſſe it ſelfe, &amp; afflictions, which are by themſelues euil, becauſe they deſtroie nature. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we pray againſt death, as being euil by it ſelfe; and chriſt himſelfe alſo praied againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Let this cup paſſe from me; neuertheles not as I wil, but as thou wilt.</hi> As then death was a deſtruction, a torment, and euill, ſo Chriſt praied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and woulde it not; yea neither woulde the Father himſelfe it, as it is ſo conſidered. But as Chriſts death was a Raunſome on the croſſe, ſo both Chriſt, and the Father would the ſame.</p>

But God wil not ſimplie temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, nether in this reſpect, as they are a deſtruction, but as they are exerciſes of faith and praier, or martyrdomes, or a trial of our conſcience: and in this reſpect and ſo farre we ought alſo to wiſh them but not ſimply. And that we are not ſimply to wil or wiſh temptations, or afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by eaſily appeareth, becauſe it is patience, to ſuffer them: which it ſhould not be, but rather our duty, if we ought ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to wiſhe them, neither might wee praie againſt them.

Wherefore in vaine doe we deſire it. For al that will liue godlie in Chriſt Ieſu, muſt ſuffer perſequutions.</hi> Aunſwere. This is a falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy putting that for a cauſe, which is no cauſe. For therefore
<pb n="1045" facs="tcp:19538:531"/>
deſire we that we be not lead into temptation, not becauſe we are wholy to be deliuered, but, 1. <hi>Becauſe wee are deliuered from manie things, in which we ſhould periſh, if wee ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt deliueraunce.</hi> This is a cauſe ſufficient. 2. <hi>That thoſe euils alſo into which we fal, maie be good and profitable vnto vs.</hi> And to thoſe which deſire in general deliueraunce wil God graunt theſe two ſo great bleſſings. But yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the remaines of ſinne in vs hee wil haue this benefit to be imperfect, which neuertheleſſe we are to aske vvholy with ſubmitting of our will vnto the will of God, and with ful perſuaſion, that in the, life to come we ſhall wholie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to obſerue the order, &amp; coherence of theſe petitions. 1. <hi>The Lord commaunded vs to deſire the true knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, &amp; his promiſe, which is the cauſe of al other his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee willeth vs to deſire, that god woulde gouerne vs by his ſpirite, and ſo continually preſerue, and confirme vs in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> 3. <hi>That euerie of vs maie do and fulfil thereby his duty in his vocation and calling.</hi> 4. <hi>That he would giue vs thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by euery one may doe his duty, namely corporall bleſſinges.</hi> The fourth petition then agreeth with the former: becauſe, if we muſt at al be in our own vocation and calling, we muſt liue, and haue thinges neceſſary for the mainteinaunce of our life. 5. <hi>He adioineth next after the petition of ſpiritual and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings, a verie fit obiection of our vnwoorthines: That thou maieſt giue vs ſpiritual &amp; corporal bleſſings, forgiue vs our debts.</hi> Wherefore the fift petition is the ground and foundation of the reſt, which being ouerthrown, the reſt fal to ground. For if thou reſolue not, that thou haſt god gracious and fauourable vnto thee, how ſhalt thou haue him to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful? how ſhalt thou continu in that knowlege, which thou haſt not? how ſhalt thou doe thy duty, and the wil of God, ſeeing thou art his enemy, and endeuoureſt the contrarie? how ſhalt thou aſcribe al things to god? how ſhal they turn to thy ſaluation? 6. <hi>After the petition of ſpirituall and corporall bleſſinges, there followeth laſtlie the petition of our deliueraunce from euils both preſent and to come. And from this laſt petition we returne againe to the firſt: Deliuer vs from all euils both of crime &amp; pain, both preſent &amp; to come, that we maie know thee to be our perfect ſauior, &amp; ſo thy name may be hallowed &amp; ſanctified of vs.</hi>
